Book</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Dear Schoolmate</span>:</p>

<p>This is a stay-at-home story, the only one
in our series. We have been to Greece and
Spain, to Russia, Germany, and France, to
Belgium, to Japan, to Ireland and Mexico, to
Armenia and Scotland and Italy. We played
with the royal children in the palace of the
Tsar, before their great tragedy touched
them; we went to school in Paris with Geneviève,
and in Aintab with Archag, and out to
domestic service with Mattina in Athens; we
sang Spanish riddles with Pilarica, and listened
to Scottish hero-tales with the young
Laird; we lived in a Mexican cave and sailed
in a Japanese boat; we spent Christmas in
Germany, before the War; we tramped the
roads of Ireland with gay Finn, before the
revolution; we followed Pieter when he
fought for his Belgium; and we came home
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</span>
from the Italian victory in a little Sicilian
cart of many colors. And now we are going
to stay at home and live as Americans live,
and get acquainted with ourselves and each
other.</p>

<p>America is a palace of a thousand windows,
some of them opening on the past and some
of them looking toward the future; and in my
letters to you I have tried to open a few of
the windows that look back into our pasts;
magic casements they are, for we have as
many pasts as we have races in America. And
two things I have tried to tell you about those
races:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Why they came to America</div>
    <div class="verse indent10">and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What they brought to America.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Turn over the pages of the letters, if you
have kept them, and you will find that they
are really chapters in a short history of
America’s colonists and immigrants. All the
chapters are not written yet, all the windows
are not opened; some day perhaps there will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</span>
be a Scandinavian chapter to tell us why the
hardy, industrious Norse and Swedes are here,
farming our northwestern prairies, and what
gifts they brought to make America more
beautiful; and some day we may open a Dutch
window, looking across the perilous sea from
old New York to Holland.</p>

<p>But this time, my letter is not a little chapter
of past history, for most of the young people
in this story are descendants of the Puritans
who settled New England and the Cavaliers
who settled Virginia; and we already know
by heart those two chapters of our past. Don’t
we? Plymouth Rock, Paul Revere, Pocahontas:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0a">“<i>A cargo of tea</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Thrown into the sea,</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>In seventeen-hundred</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>And sixty-three.</i>”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Those are the keys which unlock that magic
casement. You can open it for yourself, anytime.
The “Round Robin” window which
I am opening in this letter, looks not into the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</span>
past nor yet into the future, but into the
present. It looks right into the hearts of
American boys and girls of to-day.</p>

<p>From the East and the West and the North
and the South of our United States they come.
Two or three, in the story, have fathers who
were foreign born, but most of them are of
“American Stock,” as we say when we mean
that our great-grandfathers and great-grandmothers
were the children of English colonists.
We say it proudly, we whose ancestors
fought the American Revolution, whose grandfathers
saw the passing of slavery, whose
brothers did their bit in the Great War.
Proudly, because we believe that whatsoever
of freedom, of democracy, of holiness there
is in America to-day, was first planted and
rooted here by our ancestors, those first English
settlers.</p>

<p>Narrow-minded and narrow-hearted people
who look with near-sighted spirits through
the windows of the past and the windows of
the future, bewail the fact that one hundred
years from now, “American Stock” will no
longer mean to American Schoolchildren,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</span>
English inheritance. Because, dear Schoolmate,
your children and your grandchildren
will have married and intermarried with
Americans of Latin and Teutonic and Slavic
and other blood—&#8203;with the American grandchildren
of Italians, and French, and Germans,
and Swedes, and Russians, and Syrians—&#8203;and
who knows how many other races? But
these narrow-minded, narrow-hearted, unvisionary
people forget that if our America
is a free, a democratic, a holy place, one hundred
years from now, the American Stock will
still be rooted true in the old ideals. And
it is by ideals that countries live and are
judged.</p>

<p>To Americanize a person means to find out
how much, or how little, he knows and cares
about freedom and democracy and holiness,
and then to help that much or little grow.
And all this is done by making friends with
the foreigners who come to us from other
lands. Making friends with people, as you
know very well, means understanding them,
loving them, making allowance for them and
remembering that they have to make allowance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</span>
for us also. It means studying their
ways, and especially their ways of achieving
freedom, their ways of achieving democracy,
their ways of achieving holiness—&#8203;as well as
expecting them to study and approve of our
ways. Perhaps some of their ways are better
than some of ours. If they are, then we shall
certainly want to adopt those ways; if they
are not, then we must do our American best
to convince these immigrant friends that our
ways are better. We mustn’t think that a way
is bad just because it isn’t our way, and we
mustn’t think a way is good just because it is
our way.</p>

<p>So you see that Americanizing people
means much more than teaching them English,
and telling them about George Washington
and Abraham Lincoln, and showing them
how to use bathtubs and ballot boxes. It
means making sure that they know what freedom
means, and what democracy means (Do
you know, dear Schoolmate?) and what holiness
means; and that their hearts and souls
are set toward making America a free, a
democratic, a holy nation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</span>
Look into the hearts of the children in this
Round Robin, and you will find growing there
the old ideals whose names I am repeating
so often in this letter, freedom, democracy,
holiness; you will find them in the hearts of
the young Americans whose fathers were
foreign born (I’ll wait and let Miss Abbie
Farwell Brown tell you which those are), as
well as in Beverly’s courteous little Southern
heart, and Nancy’s staunch little New England
heart, and Dick’s jolly little wholesome
heart of the West. The children in the story
would be astonished if they knew that I was
saying these things about them. They are just
“a bunch” of honest, happy boys and girls,
off on a typical American holiday in a summer
camp, learning to “get together.” But
getting together is the A B C of freedom and
democracy and holiness.</p>

<p>It is the A B C of holiness because holiness
is “getting together” with God: “Thou shalt
love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and
with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.” And
getting together with God means finding out
God’s will and then doing it; working with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</span>
Him; building up the nation with Him. And
the way to get together with God is by prayer;
and by looking back through the ages and following
the working of His will in His world,
as we see it in the Bible, and in all secular
science, art, history, and literature; and then
by more prayer. “Thy Kingdom come, Thy
Will be done, <em>on earth</em>, as it is in heaven.”
That is the prayer of the nation builder, who
has “got together” with God. And every
American is a nation builder.</p>

<p>It is the A B C of democracy because democracy
is “getting together” with your fellow-men:
“And thou shalt love thy neighbor as
thyself.” Fellowship, brotherhood, equal opportunity,
all these come from loving thy
neighbor as thyself. Government of the people,
by the people, for the people, must fail
just so long as we fail to love our neighbor
as ourself. Democracy means loving all the
people all the time; not just one kind of people,
the rich, or the poor, or the bankers, or
the bakers, or the people who live in our
street, but <em>all</em> the people, <em>all</em> the time. In a
Democracy, every man is our neighbor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</span>
It is the A B C of freedom, because freedom
is “getting together” with the Golden Rule:
“Do unto others as you would that they should
do unto you.” You can’t be free by yourself;
not in America; not in the world. Even if
you were a self-supporting hermit, or a Robinson
Crusoe, you wouldn’t be free. Solitude
isn’t freedom. You wouldn’t be free to marry,
alone on a desert island. A man is free when
he is at peace with himself. But no man is
really at peace with himself so long as some
other man is not at peace. God made us so.
Even if we are self-righteous and think that
we are not to blame for our neighbor’s unhappiness,
we can’t be at peace while he is miserable
before our eyes and in our ears; but to
have to run away from misery isn’t freedom.
What does this mean, dear Schoolmate?
Why! it means that you and I can never be
free until everyone is free. It means that freedom
is a spiritual goal; but you don’t have
to beat the other fellow to it; the game is to
have everybody come up to time. And to have
everybody come up to time, we must all play
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</span>
the game according to the rule; be good
sports!</p>

<p>And now, you will tell me that these ideals
are not merely American, they are the ideals
for which every Christian nation ought to
strive. That may be; but America has a
special claim to them, for it was our English
colonial ancestors who put them into political
form for us, and breathed their spirit into this
government of ours which we called a Republic.
We think that freedom, democracy, and
holiness have a better chance to grow in our
Republic than in the earlier forms of government,
such as monarchy. Republics, such as
ours, may not be the last word in political
freedom, and democracy, and holiness; there
may be newer forms of government in which
people may have a better chance to be holy,
democratic, and free than they have in ours;
all history shows how men and governments
have grown and changed, down the ages; to
grow is to change. But so long as we do think
that our ideals have a better chance in a Republic
than in anything else, we can keep our
government a Republic; for it is we who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</span>
choose what America shall be; it is we who
cast the votes. That is what it means to be
an American.</p>

<p>And because freedom and holiness and
democracy are the ideals for which every
Christian nation ought to strive—&#8203;and this the
nations know, in their secret hearts, as well as
you and I know it, dear Schoolmate—&#8203;because
their ideals and ours are really the same, we
have, in those ideals, the basis and groundwork,
and starting point for an international
brotherhood of nations; the one sure way of
getting together.</p>

<h3>THE GOLDEN GIRL</h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Six</span> girls and a terrier puppy were waiting
on the wharf at Old Harbor for the
boat to come in. Of course there were
many other persons gathered besides these;
for the arrival of the daily mail boat was the
great event of the little Maine seaport. But
the six girls in their brown middies, flitting
about like gay thrushes, seemed to take up
most of the room on the little pier; to say nothing
of the omnipresent pup.</p>

<p>Although they were dressed almost exactly
alike, and were of nearly the same age, they
were as different as six girls could well be.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
One was tall and quiet, with a straight thick
mane of fair hair. One was short, dark and
round, and spoke with a quaint accent. One
had a rich olive skin, great serious brown eyes,
and a black braid thick as your arm. One
was freckled like a meadow lily, with a snub
nose and sandy curls. The fifth was a slender,
dainty brunette with tiny hands and feet and
a delightful Southern drawl. The last of the
six had features like the tall, quiet girl. But
she was sturdier and quicker. There was a
ripple in her chestnut hair and a twinkle in
her blue eyes that marked this Yankee from
her English cousin.</p>

<p>These two, arm in arm, were leaning over
the railing of the pier, exchanging jokes with
a big red-haired boy in a dory below, who
was doing mysterious things with a landing
net.</p>

<p>“Ho! There, you’ve lost another one,
Dick!” cried the lively girl of the watching
pair. “A great cowboy you are, and can’t
catch a crab!”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet I could do it with a lasso, Nancy,”
grinned the boy good-naturedly, “though the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
critters do have nex’ to no necks.” Dick Reed
was always making atrocious puns like this
one, which the girls pretended not to notice.
“I figured I’d get a nice mess for all our suppers.
But”—&#8203;he glanced ruefully at the
two small red objects sidling about the bottom
of the dory, “I reckon I’ll have to make
it a private donation to the newest comer; a
sort of peace-offering. Say, do you suppose
she will like ’em?”</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t she like them?” asked
Cicely Vane, the English girl, in her clear
soft tones.</p>

<p>“Yes? Why shouldn’t she like them?”
Nancy Batchelder repeated her cousin’s question
in her more animated and penetrating
voice. “I suppose she eats like the rest of us.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll soon see,” said Dick, landing
another crab dexterously. “There you are,
old Sidestepper! And proud you ought to be
to make a lunch for the Golden Girl.”</p>

<p>“Hush, Dick!” cautioned Nancy, “Don’t
let any stranger hear you call her that. It
sounds so—&#8203;so vulgar. You’ll forget sometime,
and she will hear you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
“She’s got good ears if she can hear me
now,” muttered Dick.</p>

<p>“We used to call her that last summer,”
Nancy whispered to her chum. “You know,
she has lived here longer than any of us,
really. But I don’t believe she knows the nice,
dear corners of Old Harbor, or the nice, dear
comfortable people as well as we do. She
never went anywhere off her father’s place,
they say, except to ride or drive or sail in
his yacht. Though when she was a tiny little
girl she used to run down to Cap’n Sackett’s
often. That was before Nelly went there to
live.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t she come to see you at the camp?”
queried Cicely, wondering at the inconsistent
ways of these Americans, in a land where
everyone was supposed to be “equal.” “I
should have thought she would be lonesome
in that big house.”</p>

<p>“Dear me, no!” laughed Nancy. “She
never even looked at us in those days. You
ought to have seen her nose go up in the air
when she passed us in the motor. She had
girls and boys on house parties to visit her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
sometimes. But they came from far away,
and flocked by themselves. Mrs. Poole, her
stepmother, is a dressy, snobby kind of woman.
I’m glad my mother isn’t like that! The people
here scarcely know her by sight. Nobody
likes Mr. Poole, either. He is what they call
a ‘hard man,’ whatever that may mean.”</p>

<p>“In England it has something to do with
money and not being kind,” said Cicely
vaguely. “I don’t think I shall like this rich
girl of yours, Nancy.”</p>

<p>“Don’t call her <em>mine</em>!” Nancy hastened to
disclaim, with a little shake to her cousin’s
shoulders. “I didn’t want her to come. Nobody
did. But as Mother said, what could
you do, when Mr. Poole wrote so strangely, to
say that he and Mrs. Poole were going suddenly
away with the baby, and that there
would be no other place for them to leave
Anne? Just imagine! He said Anne had always
spent her summers at Old Harbor; and
now mightn’t she stay at Mother’s camp with
us girls, to learn the simple life, which would
be good for her!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>“My word!” commented Cicely. “How
odd! Was that all her father said?”</p>

<p>“I think so. Anyway, you know Mother.
After she had read that letter backward and
forward—&#8203;and upside down, for all I know—&#8203;she
sighed and said—&#8203;‘Poor little Golden
Girl! I don’t understand her father. But I
guess we ought to have her here and be nice
to her.’”</p>

<p>“Dear Tante!” exclaimed Cicely. “She
couldn’t help but be nice to anyone. But why
did she call this Anne a ‘poor’ little girl?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Nancy. “I wonder.”</p>

<p>Their wonderings were cut short by a cry
from the other side of the pier. “Boat ahoy!
Hi, Nancy!”</p>

<p>It was a tall young man in a flannel shirt
and knickerbockers who called out to his sister
over the heads of the crowd.</p>

<p>“Come on, girls!” summoned Nancy, who
seemed to be their leader. And the little
brown flock fluttered forward to the edge of
the pier. “Now, when I say ‘One—&#8203;two—&#8203;<em>three</em>!’
be ready with the yell. We’ll start her
right with a rousing welcome, anyway.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>The little steamer was just rounding the
point of the nearest island. Evidently there
were not many persons on board. It was still
early in the season and many of the summer
cottages were as yet unopened. On the upper
deck was standing just one person. As the boat
drew near one could see that this was a girl
in a fur stole, who seemed to be looking earnestly
at the group on the wharf.</p>

<p>“That must be Anne Poole,” said Nancy
to her Club. And she whispered in Cicely’s
ear—&#8203;“I’m nervous! I don’t know why. She
seems to me like a foreigner, though she’s not.
But you didn’t, and you are!”</p>

<p>The sentence sounded mixed. But Cicely
seemed to understand and squeezed her
cousin’s arm. These two were old friends as
well as relatives. For though this was Cicely
Vane’s first visit to America, Nancy Batchelder
had several times been to Cicely’s home
in England, the country of Nancy’s own long-ago
ancestors.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr">Qu’elle est chic!</i>” murmured Gilda Bétemps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
“But how pale!” added Norma, the dark
girl.</p>

<p>“I wish Mother would let me bob my hair,”
thought Nancy, looking enviously at the newcomer’s
boyish head.</p>

<p>“What lovely clothes!” sighed the pretty
Southerner, noting every detail of hat and
coat and dainty shoes. “I can’t imagine her
in this rig!”</p>

<p>“She looks stiff and unhappy,” thought the
English girl. What Nelly Sackett thought
she did not say. Her lips were pursed together
and she eyed the Golden Girl with keen
blue eyes.</p>

<p>“Now, come on, girls! Go to it, Doughboy!”
Nancy admonished the puppy. “One
two—&#8203;<em>three</em>!” Six girlish voices, aided by a
deeper masculine trio, burst into a wild yell.
“Heia, hoia! Together! Get together!”</p>

<p>“<em>Bow—&#8203;wow—&#8203;wow!</em>” barked Doughboy,
quivering with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The girl on the steamer looked first surprised
then interested, as she saw six handkerchiefs
waved in her direction, while a little
dog bounded frantically up and down like a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
rubber ball. She had not expected a welcome
like this. Though indeed she had not known
what to expect, it was all so strange. A little
color crept into her pale cheeks and she bowed
her head slightly.</p>

<p>“Some airs!” sniffed Dick Reed. Then he
disappeared into the background, where
Hugh and Victor were getting the motor boat
ready for passengers.</p>

<p>The little steamer picked her way gingerly
to the pier. The gang plank was let down,
and presently the Golden Girl was tripping
ashore on high-heeled shoes. Nancy stepped
forward with a well-meaning smile. “You
are Miss Anne Poole?” she said, “And I am
Nancy Batchelder from Round Robin. I’m
glad to welcome you. My mother was sorry
not to be here, too. But she is busy getting
luncheon ready.” Anne Poole stared. Her
hostess was busy, getting her own luncheon!
What a funny place! Then she glanced
around with a start; for already the gang
plank was hauled in and the steamer was
about to move away. “Oh, my bags!” she
cried. “Didn’t anyone bring them ashore?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
“Three trunks have come off,” volunteered
Nancy, as who should <span class="lock">say,—</span>“Isn’t that enough
for anybody?”</p>

<p>“No, bags; two handbags besides. One has
my jewelry in it. I left them on the seat. I
thought someone would bring them.” Anne
Poole stood helpless.</p>

<p>The steamer’s bell rang. “Oh, Captain!
Wait a minute! She’s left her bags!” Nancy
called. Like a flash she jumped onto the
steamer, over the railing, ran to the upper
deck and soon reappeared with a big and a
little bag, which the other girls helped her
to hand ashore. Then once more she stood
on the pier beside the astonished Anne, before
either she or the Captain had recovered
breath, or the steamer had got under way.</p>

<p>“We have to help ourselves and move
quickly, or we get left, you see,” said Nancy,
laughing at the girl’s amazed expression.</p>

<p>“I supposed there would be porters,” Anne
repeated stiffly. “I never lift bags. But then,
I never came to Old Harbor on the steamer
before. Father always brought us down on
the yacht.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
“It’s quite different when you come by
steamer. You’ll find a lot of things different
I guess,” grinned Nancy rather wickedly.</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” remarked Anne, lifting her
eyebrows with a bored expression.</p>

<h3>THE ROUND ROBIN CLUB</h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">People</span> were already drifting away
from the pier. “Hugh and Victor are
waiting to take us to Camp in the motor
boat,” explained Nancy. “I’ll just introduce
you to the Round Robin before we start.
Don’t you think we have a nice yell? There
are six of us, you see; you will make the
seventh girl. The boys are Associates. Mother
and the Twins are Honorary.”</p>

<p>Nancy chattered so fast that the newcomer
was quite bewildered. Perhaps it was the best
way to get over an awkward moment, for the
Club was oddly tongue-tied. They did not all
know one another very well as yet, the summer
being so young. They were not awed by
the Golden Girl; but they did not like the
way she looked at them. “How queer these
people are.” She seemed to be thinking. “I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
knew they would be.” She said nothing, however,
and perhaps they mistook her real
thoughts.</p>

<p>Nancy began her introduction, putting her
arm about Cicely’s shoulders. “This is my
cousin Cicely Vane of England,” she said.</p>

<p>“How do you do?” said Cicely prettily.
Anne nodded coldly as the name of each girl
was given.</p>

<p>“This is Gilda Bétemps, who was born in
Belgium,” went on Nancy, drawing forward
the short, round girl whose pleasant face was
beaming. “She doesn’t speak English very
easily yet. But she is getting on. She is going
to be an American all the rest of her life.”</p>

<p>“I gave some money for the Belgian children,
and a lot of old clothes,” said Anne,
staring at Gilda with some interest. “What
a dreadful thing to say!” inwardly commented
the other girls. But Gilda only smiled.</p>

<p>“And this,” Nancy indicated the brunette
of the group, “is Norma Sonnino, who is going
to be a great musician some day, like her
grandfather. She sings like a—&#8203;like a round
robin!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
Norma blushed and rolled her eyes.
“Nancy is always laughing at me,” she said,
showing dazzling white teeth. “Like a round
robin indeed!”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know anybody who can sing
better than the round robin we named our
camp for; the fellow who sings on top of the
spruce tree every morning—&#8203;‘<cite>Get up, get up!
Get uppity up!</cite>’ And his sunset song, Norma!”</p>

<p>“<i lang="it">Grazie tante!</i>” said Norma, shrugging her
shoulders, but smiling too.</p>

<p>“Another foreigner!” thought Anne Poole.
“That makes three of them already. What
an odd group for <em>me</em>!” And her little nose
rose higher in the air.</p>

<p>Norma was not a foreigner. Her people
had not lived in America so long as had the
people of Nancy or Beverly or Nelly Sackett.
But Norma was just as truly an American as
they; since her Italian-born father was now a
naturalized citizen, a merchant in New York
where she herself had been born.</p>

<p>“I am Beverly Peyton, of Virginia,”
drawled the pretty Southerner, waiting for
no introduction and holding out her hand
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
cordially. Beverly had not forgotten how
cold the first greeting of these Northern girls
had seemed to her warm Southern heart, when
a week earlier she had arrived, a stranger to
all but the Batchelders. She knew that they
were not really cold; it was just the Yankee
offhand way. But she wanted to cheer up
this pale, big-eyed newcomer.</p>

<p>Anne, however, did not seem to appreciate
Beverly’s advance. She dropped the warm
little hand as soon as convenient, and stood
staring at the last of the six girls—&#8203;the freckled,
sandy one.</p>

<p>“I know you,” she said. “You’re Captain
Sackett’s niece. I used to call him Uncle
Eph’ once. Are you a member of this Club,
too?” There was something in the way she
said it that made Nelly Sackett flush and draw
back the hand she had half extended, following
Beverly’s lead.</p>

<p>“Of course she is a member of the Round
Robin,” said Nancy, clapping Nelly on the
shoulder in a boyish fashion. “We couldn’t
do without Nelly, though she doesn’t live at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
Camp. She lives at Cap’n Sackett’s, a mile
and a half away.”</p>

<p>“The idea of a fisherman’s daughter in my
Club!” thought Anne Poole. “Well!” Just
then a whoop rent the air and the cry—&#8203;“Hurry
up, girls!”</p>

<p>“The boys are getting impatient,” Nancy
explained to Anne. “They’re always in a
hurry. Your trunks are in the motor-boat
already; three of them! I guess the boys
didn’t bargain for more than one. We shall
be pretty crowded. But we shan’t mind, if
you don’t.”</p>

<p>Anne had seen two roughly-dressed young
men struggling with her boxes, while a red-haired
boy walked away with her suit-case.
She had supposed them to be porters. What
was her amazement to learn they were to be
her neighbors and camp companions in this
strange summer. For the bronze young man
wearing the service star was Hugh Batchelder,
it seemed. And his taller friend with the
silver star of a wounded veteran was Victor
Lanfranc, late of the French Flying Corps.
While the funny Dick Reed, whom they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
called “Reddy,” and who shook Anne’s arm
up and down like a pump handle, when he
was introduced, much to her disgust, was
being tutored by Hugh Batchelder at his
mother’s camp.</p>

<p>Presently the <i>Togo</i> full of girls and boys
and trunks and puppy, all comfortably mingled,
was chugging away over the blue waters
of the Harbor into a wild, beautiful section
of the “country of the pointed firs.” The air
was pungent with the smell of balsam and bay
and sweet fern, mingled with a salty fragrance
that is the breath of life to true Yankees, and
which even Beverly Peyton’s aristocratic little
Southern nose was beginning to love. Perched
awkwardly on one of her own trunks, Anne
Poole scanned the rocky shore eagerly, as they
approached a high point.</p>

<p>“I suppose of course you know all about
this coast?” said Nancy, trying to make conversation.
“You used to sail around so much.
We often saw your father’s yacht last summer.”</p>

<p>Anne sighed. “I shall miss that,” she said.</p>

<p>“Hugh has looked up all the places around
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
here,” Nancy went on. “The Bay is full of
<span class="lock">history——”</span></p>

<p>“And fish,” interrupted Dick, below his
breath.</p>

<p>“I don’t know about the history,” said Anne.
“But I think I do know that Point. I never
came just this way before. But isn’t that Idlewild?”</p>

<p>“Yes. That is Idlewild. And here is where
Nelly gets off.” They were at the entrance
of a little cove, at the end of which a good-sized
white house stood alone. On the shore
were some low grey sheds; lobster pots lay
about and a dory was moored a little way
from shore. The <i>Togo</i> drew up at the tiny
pier and Nelly Sackett jumped nimbly out.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Nelly! Don’t forget to-morrow,”
called Nancy.</p>

<p>“It’s not likely I’ll forget!” grinned Nelly
Sackett.</p>

<p>“And please, ask Cap’n Sackett about the
lobsters?” Nancy reminded her.</p>

<p>“He’ll have them ready,” promised Nelly.
“He’s going hauling, I know, to-morrow.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
He’ll be back by ten. The lobsters will be
ready.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Nelly! Good-bye!”</p>

<p>“Heia! Hoia! Together! Get together!”
yelled the Club as the boat chugged away;
the same call with which they had greeted
Anne. The latter did not join in the yell.
It was too strange to her.</p>

<p>“Here we come to Idlewild!” As the boat
drew near the Point they could see a great
stone house on top of a cliff; a garage, summer
houses, and the glass roofs of greenhouses.
But there was no flag flying on the tall flagstaff
above the boat house. The place seemed
deserted. Every window was shuttered, giving
the house the look of a blind person.
There were no boats moored off the little pier.</p>

<p>“How dead it looks!” thought Anne. But
she said aloud complacently—&#8203;“It’s the finest
place anywhere within fifty miles; Father
says so.”</p>

<p>“It certainly is the biggest place,” agreed
Nancy. “But wait till you see Round Robin!”</p>

<p>“I wish I was going to be here,” said Anne
simply; and Beverly Peyton saw her lip
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
tremble. “I never went anywhere else in the
summer, except when we went to Europe. I
liked Idlewild.” Anne could not say any more.</p>

<p>“We will come over and see it some day,
Anne,” said Beverly sweetly. “It is only about
a mile from Camp, they say. I’ve wanted to
come very much.”</p>

<p>“So have I,” said Nancy. “In all the years
I’ve never been on shore here. We’ll all go,
if you will invite us, Anne.”</p>

<p>Anne did not say anything. She was watching
the roofs of Idlewild fade out of sight,
and she looked wistful.</p>

<p>The others were already planning for to-morrow
and seemed to have forgotten the newcomer.</p>

<h3>FAIRY RING</h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Across</span> a smooth stretch of bay dotted
with tiny islets, past cliffs with great
black fissures in the side; through a
narrow channel between grim reefs and the
ragged shore, went the <i>Togo</i>. Never a house
did they pass. Never another boat did they
meet. For Round Robin was hidden in an
entirely wild part of the shore, too far from
Old Harbor to suit most city people. The
branch road ended at the Batchelders’ place.
Beyond was wilderness. It was this very
wildness that the Batchelders and their
friends liked most; and because of it they had
chosen this spot for their summer camp.</p>

<p>“Of course you know this Bay was once a
great place for Indians?” said Dick, who came
from an Indian-frequented part of the country.
But Anne knew nothing of Indians and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
their history. “They had a village somewhere
along here, Hugh says; Hugh is great on history.
And out on that island away off there,”
Reddy pointed into the misty east, “there was
a terrible massacre once.”</p>

<p>Anne looked shocked. “There was a shipwreck
on that reef,” volunteered Nancy, indicating
a row of brown teeth piercing
through foam.</p>

<p>“Better than that,” called out Hugh from
the tiller, “did you girls know that this was
the scene of a big sea-fight during the Revolution?
One of my ancestors, who was master
of a little fishing schooner, decoyed a British
man-of-war right on to that shoal over there,
and took him prisoner.”</p>

<p>“It’s not polite of you to mention it in
Cicely’s presence,” laughed Nancy. “You
might hurt her feelings.”</p>

<p>“Dear me, no!” protested Cicely. “We
have forgotten all the grudges of those days,
haven’t we? Our countries are just allies,
aren’t they?”</p>

<p>“Of course they are!” said Hugh saluting
like a soldier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
“Sure we are!” cried Victor doing likewise.
“Ask France, too!”</p>

<p>“Look, Anne!” interrupted Dick, “that
island out there is where Captain Kidd is said
to have hidden his treasure. Maybe we shall
find it this summer, who knows?”</p>

<p>“Pooh! They tell that same story about
every island off the coast.” Nancy snubbed
him.</p>

<p>“Well, he did hide it somewhere, didn’t
he?” insisted Dick. “And nobody has ever
found it yet? So!”</p>

<p>“This is the place where Gilda fell overboard
while we were fishing yesterday.”
Norma pointed out the place.</p>

<p>“Ze wasser was ve’y damp!” Gilda shrugged
with a little frown. And they all began to
laugh, even Anne, at the funny expression.</p>

<p>“And here’s where we go in bathing,” said
Beverly, showing Anne a little sandy beach as
they passed. “It is cold, oh, so cold! But
it is fun, when you get used to it.”</p>

<p>“We had a heated pool at Idlewild,” said
Anne dubiously. “I don’t like bathing in
cold sea-water.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
“It’s the way we take our daily baths,” said
Nancy. “There isn’t any running water at
the camp, you know. There’s just the spring
outside the kitchen. We have to bring in
what we want in buckets, the way the first settlers
did. Oh, it’s quite primitive, Anne!”</p>

<p>“No bathrooms then? No electric lights,
I suppose?” Everybody began to laugh.
Dick fished something from his pocket and
flashed a torch in Anne’s face. “Of course we
have electricity,” he said. “Everybody is his
own firefly.”</p>

<p>Anne looked more and more pained at these
revelations. They were approaching a point
dark with fir trees, that made out into the
water beside a tiny cove. There was a strip
of pebbly beach, with a landing pier, from
the end of which a path went wavering up
the bank and disappeared into the woods.
Anne caught a glimpse, through the trees, of
a low log shack, and some brown canvas
tents that seemed to blend in like a part of
the woods.</p>

<p>“Here we are! Let’s give the camp yell,”
suggested Nancy. And once again the newcomer’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
ears were deafened by the strange cry,
“Heia! Hoia! Together! Round Robin!”</p>

<p>There was a high answering call; and down
the slip came hurrying a tall, sweet-faced
woman in a blue dress and big apron, followed
by two little capering boys. The terrier
pup could not wait another minute, but
leaped out of the boat and ran to greet the
children, barking noisily as if trying to tell
them about his wonderful trip to the Harbor
to meet the Stranger.</p>

<p>The woman, whom everyone called “Tante,”
came straight to Anne and took her cordially
by both hands. “Welcome to Round Robin,
Anne,” she said. “I am very glad to see you.
These are my Twins, Eddie and Freddie.
Shake hands, boys.”</p>

<p>The Twins stared at Anne with unfeigned
interest. “Yes, her hair is a sort of gold—&#8203;”
began Freddie. But Dick interrupted further
comment on the Golden Girl by grabbing him
up bodily and racing off, followed by Eddie
and Doughboy in a tandem.</p>

<p>“I hope you will like our camp, Dear,” said
Mrs. Batchelder, as they followed the girls
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
up the path, leaving the young men to bring
the luggage. “We have very happy times
here together. Though you have never
camped before, you will soon get used to the
queerness, I am sure.”</p>

<p>There was something so motherly and kind
in her manner that a lump came in Anne’s
throat. She turned abruptly, in what seemed
a sulky way, and said nothing.</p>

<p>“I t’ink s’e is not pleasant, <i lang="fr">non</i>?” whispered
Gilda to Norma. And the latter shrugged
her shoulders. “I’m glad she is not my tentmate,”
she remarked. “But Beverly can get
along with her, if anyone can.”</p>

<p>The pretty path led to a quaint cabin made
of rough logs, such as the Pilgrims built in
Plymouth when they first landed. There was
a broad piazza, however, which those busy
Pilgrims would have had no time to enjoy.
On it were Gloucester hammocks, rough-finished
chairs, and a table which Dick had
made. “This is Round Robin,” said Tante,
“where we meet to eat and work and dance
and spend rainy hours. A real round robin
himself has a nest in the top of that spruce
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
tree. And the Twins and I have our nests
upstairs. But I am sure you will like sleeping
in a tent, Anne. The boys have pitched their
tents down that path about fifty rods away,
beside their favorite swimming place. That
is where Dick does his studying every morning.
Now, Beverly, I will turn Anne over
to your Southern hospitality. You will make
her feel at home as soon as possible, I know.”</p>

<p>The other girls had already disappeared on
various errands. “This way to the Fairy
Ring!” drawled Beverly, with her pretty
smile. “That is what Nancy calls our tent
circle. They do look rather like brown mushrooms,
don’t they? Do you-all like mushrooms?
We are beginning to find lovely ones
in the woods.”</p>

<p>“Toadstools!” Anne exclaimed in disgust.
“I’m afraid of the nasty things. Of course,
I like the ones we get in the city,” she qualified,
remembering.</p>

<p>“Wild ones are best,” declared Beverly.
“You’ll learn to know the difference. But
don’t be fooled by the rich-looking Amanita.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
It’s deadly! Well, here’s our mushroom—&#8203;not
too much-room, as Reddy says.”</p>

<p>They stood at the entrance to one of the
little brown tents. Anne stared. “Goodness!”
she said. “And I shall have only half of
that?”</p>

<p>Two narrow cots stood against the sides of
the tent; a small mirror hung from the post
between them at the farther end, over a rough
box that seemed to serve for a dressing table.
There were, besides Beverly’s steamer trunk
already in place, two camp stools, and a
clothes-line stretched across the tent, on which
dangled certain girlish garments. That was
all. What a contrast to the dainty boudoir
Anne had left behind in Chicago!</p>

<p>“I keep things that mustn’t get damp inside
my bed,” said Beverly demurely. “I don’t
know what Tante would say. She is so tidy.
Your trunk will go there, opposite mine.”</p>

<p>“I have three trunks,” answered Anne sulkily.
“I don’t see where they can go.”</p>

<p>Beverly laughed. “All full of clothes?”
Anne nodded. “Well, you’ll never want them
here, I reckon,” drawled the Southern girl.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
“You’ll keep them in the store-room, and be
glad to get rid of them. You will never need
to wear anything but <em>this</em>—&#8203;in Camp, at least.”
She glanced down at her khaki costume. Anne
sniffed.</p>

<p>“I never shall like it,” she said. “It’s so
coarse and ugly.”</p>

<p>“I never shall like it,” she repeated in a
letter to her father which she hastened to
write that same afternoon, while she was supposed
to be resting. (She did not write to
her stepmother.) “Please don’t make me stay
in this old camp!” Anne continued in her
letter. “Mrs. Batchelder is lovely and kind.
But she does the cooking herself! And we
are all expected to help, taking turns at everything!
And we have to take care of our tents,
and sweep, and wait on table! Imagine it!
There aren’t any servants; and they say it is
the way the first settlers in America lived, only
easier. I think it’s horrid! Please can’t I
come to Canada, or wherever you are? I can
keep out of the way, if you’re busy. And I
won’t bother the baby.”</p>

<p>When Anne had finished her complaining
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
letter she sat looking out of the tent into the
trees, feeling very lonely. The Camp was
silent, for it was the hour when those who
wished to do so took their daily nap; while
the others were expected to study or to keep
quiet or to go away where they could be noisy
without disturbing anyone else. Even the
irrepressible Twins and Doughboy were invisible.
Victor had taken them off on a small
hike. Beverly had left Anne in undisputed
possession of the tent. She and Cicely were
going to pick wild strawberries for supper.</p>

<p>“I wonder what they are doing in Canada
now?” thought Anne wistfully. “I wonder
why Father wouldn’t let me come with them?
It must have been Mother’s idea.” Ever
since the baby came Mrs. Poole had acted
oddly. But so had Mr. Poole. He had been
different for a long time. There was something
Anne didn’t understand, and it made her
uncomfortable. Now they had sent her to
this camp of strangers. It was very hard!
Tears began to gather in her eyes, as Anne
pitied herself.</p>

<p>Just then she became aware of a commotion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
in the trees outside the tent. The birds were
screaming and complaining wildly; especially
one father robin, who seemed to be having
a fit of hysterics. “That must be the Round
Robin for whom the camp is named,” thought
Anne. “What a racket! You are so near the
birds and things in this old camp that you can’t
get away from their troubles.”</p>

<p>“<em>What!</em> What—&#8203;what—&#8203;what!” shrieked the
old robin, still more anxiously, and Anne saw
him flying back and forth about a certain tall
cedar. Then the tree itself began to shake.
The top was moving as if it were alive, thrashing
back and forth strangely.</p>

<p>“What can it be?” thought Anne, laying
down her pen and running outside. There
was certainly something up in the tree; something
alive. She caught the glitter of two
yellow eyes peering down at her. “It is an
animal!” thought Anne, and for a moment
her heart stood still. She was alone in camp
for all she knew. And Hugh had told that
noon how he had seen a wildcat in the woods
last summer. Wildcats were dangerous beasts,
sometimes. What should she do? This creature
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
was certainly furry, but it looked white.
Weren’t wildcats always grey?</p>

<p>The creature was coming down! A great
white cat-like thing, with a thick ruff around
its neck, a tail like a feather plume, fur standing
on end, and long, fierce whiskers. The
robin kept up a ceaseless protest. Evidently
he at least had reason to be afraid. Anne
stood rooted to the spot with fear, while the
animal descended. It gave a leap to the
ground and came bounding straight towards
her.</p>

<p>“<em>Purr!</em>” it cried. “<em>Purr-miaou!</em>” “Oh,
what is it?” Anne whispered aloud to the air.
But she stood her ground.</p>

<p>“Patsy! Patsy!” called a voice, and out of
the bungalow ran Nancy. “You naughty cat!
Are you bothering the birds again?”</p>

<p>“Is it only a cat?” asked Anne staring.
“Why, it looks like a wild beast!”</p>

<p>“Patsy is an honest-to-goodness cat,” Nancy
assured her proudly. “But our darling Patsy
will chase the birds. We do the best we can.
We keep him indoors at night. He has never
been away from home one single night in all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
his little life, Anne, and we don’t let him out
till after he has been fed in the morning. But
he will prowl for birds. Naughty Patsy, to
wake up our new guest, too!”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t asleep,” said Anne simply. Patsy
capered across the path and flung himself
head foremost at the girls’ feet, rolling over
in the most engaging fashion, snowy paws in
the air. “What a beauty!” cried Anne. “I
love Persian cats. They are so rare. He must
be very valuable.”</p>

<p>“He isn’t rare, and he isn’t a foreigner. He
is a Maine ‘shag cat,’ born right here in the
Harbor,” declared Nancy. “There are more
‘shags’ than ‘snug-haired cats,’ as the people
call them around here. But we like our kitties
<em>well done</em>, instead of <em>rare</em>, don’t we, Patsy?
He likes you, Anne.”</p>

<p>Sure enough. Patsy gave a winsome little
purr and ran up to Anne’s outstretched hand,
as if to welcome the newcomer, and rubbed
against her knee.</p>

<p>“You are a darling!” cried Anne, picking
up the roly-poly fellow, who wasn’t so very
big after all, being mostly fluff, like an icecream
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
soda. Patsy licked her cheek with his
pink tongue. And Anne smiled. It was the
first time Nancy had seen her smile, and she
thought how pretty Anne could be.</p>

<p>“He is a fairy cat,” announced Nancy.
“White cats are always fairies, you know.
Look out he doesn’t bewitch you, Anne!”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” cried Anne, turning up her
nose at the words, but stroking Patsy’s fur
very gently indeed. She thought Nancy talked
in a very silly way about fairy-tales, almost
as if she really believed them. She did not
yet know that Nancy loved better than anything
else to write fairy-tales herself. And
if you do a thing like that, you must at least
pretend to believe in it.</p>

<p>Already Patsy had made Anne feel that she
had a four-footed friend at camp—&#8203;which may
or may not have been bewitchment. Anyway,
she scribbled a postscript to the letter which
she had been writing:</p>

<p>“P.S. Patsy is the most beautiful cat I ever
saw; fine as the one who took the prize in the
last cat show, you remember? Only this one
is white. I am going to see if I can’t buy him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
of Nancy Batchelder and bring him home
with me when I leave this old camp. I am
sure it will be the only thing I shall want to
bring away!”</p>

<p>However, this complaining letter of Anne’s
was never sent. It remained in her pocket
until it graduated from there into the fire-place
at Round Robin. For it is a mistake
to record your impressions of any place until
you have spent at least one whole day and one
entire evening there.</p>

<p>That first evening after supper, it being
warm and dry, with a young June moon, the
Round Robin gathered on the piazza; all but
Hugh and Victor who had taken the canoe
and had gone out on the water for a little.
Perched on the piazza railing, snuggled in
the Gloucester hammocks, curled on the grass
mats, the Club purred like contented kittens
after a good supper. First they played “I’m
thinking of something.” But afterward they
voted that the night was too beautiful for any
game. Down in the pasture the fireflies were
flickering. Sweet odors came from trees and
grass and water; and sweet sounds. Now and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
again a little bird chirped away up in a treetop,
as if his happy long day was being continued
into a nice dream. The sea itself was
crooning a gentle tune.</p>

<p>“Sing, Norma!” begged somebody. And
though there was no piano or other accompaniment
than the noises of out-doors, Norma
was willing enough. She had a beautiful
voice, full and rich and mellow for a very
young girl, and she loved to sing. She began
with quaint melodies in Italian, new and
lovely things which the others had never
heard, and could not wholly understand. Her
voice seemed to melt into the night like
the wind and water. Then Norma sang old
songs in English which they all knew, and
in which they all joined, a jolly little chorus.
Anne sang as loudly as anybody, there in the
dark corner where nobody could see.</p>

<p>Presently the sound of music came from the
ocean too, where they could just spy the red
canoe gliding by in the moonlight.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr">Allons, Citoyens! Formez vos bataillons!</i>”
Victor’s pure tenor rose in the stirring strains
of the <cite>Marseillaise</cite>, Hugh joining in with a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
sturdy baritone. The June wind brought the
sound of the young veterans’ voices sweetly,
and Tante’s eyes were moist, as she thought
gratefully of what might have been. Instead,
those soldier-voices might now be breathing
up through the grasses of that land whose very
flowers seem to sing the chant of liberty. No!
There must be no more war!</p>

<p>Then Round Robin sang <cite>America</cite> with vim.
Anne noticed that there were at least two sets
of words being sung to the same melody. It
is not wholly accident that makes this old tune
the hymn of several great nations.</p>

<p>“Hooray!” shouted voices from the shore
in response to <cite>America</cite>; and then the echoes
woke to a rattling college yell. Hugh and
Victor were coming up the path, and Doughboy
scuttled barking to meet them.</p>

<p>“Well, it must be time for bed,” said Tante
presently. “I suspect Anne Poole has found
this a pretty long day, and is quite ready for
sleep?”</p>

<p>“It has been a nice day,” said Anne simply.
It might not be so bad at Round Robin, after
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
all, she thought, crumpling up the letter in
her pocket.</p>

<p>One more song they sang all together before
they separated—&#8203;their favorite song of all they
knew—&#8203;“<cite>America the Beautiful</cite>.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0a">“<i>America! America!</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>God shed His grace on thee,</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>And crown thy good with brotherhood,</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>From sea to shining sea!</i>”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The voices rang out lustily as the campers
strolled away to their various tents. And the
last word Anne heard before she swiftly
dropped off to sleep in her snug cot was
“<cite>America!</cite>” coming clearly and softly from
the tent where the young ex-soldiers lay.</p>

</div>

<h3>DICK’S CLAMBAKE</h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Anne</span> was awakened at what seemed an
unearthly hour by the sound of a bugle.
“<cite>I can’t get ’em up! I can’t get ’em
up in the morning!</cite>” Several merry voices
seemed to be singing the words which Anne
had never heard before.</p>

<p>At first she did not know where she was.
For in spite of the hard little narrow bed she
had slept like a top. The brown tent over her
head, the spicy air coming in at the open door,
the song of birds close by, and their flying
silhouettes on the canvas made the queerest
ending to her dream of home. But presently
she heard a groan from the cot opposite hers,
and remembered that she had a tent-mate.</p>

<p>“Time to get up!” Norma’s warning voice
sounded musically outside, as she passed on
her way to the kitchen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
“It’s disgusting to be wakened so early!”
moaned Beverly, rubbing her eyes. “I wonder
if I shall ever get used to it.”</p>

<p>Anne looked at her wrist-watch. “Seven!
At home I never get up till eight,” she complained.</p>

<p>“Neither do I,” Beverly yawned. “But
here some of us have to help get breakfast,
you know. And it’s all cleared away by nine!
You and I are on the dish-washing squad this
week, I reckon. So we have a few minutes’
grace.”</p>

<p>“I never washed a dish in my life,” said
Anne peevishly. She was now wide awake.</p>

<p>“It isn’t so bad when you do it together,”
said Beverly, sitting up. “We have jolly
times in the out-door pantry.”</p>

<p>The woods were ringing with laughter and
shouts. Evidently the Twins were already up
and doing, and Doughboy was helping them.
A clear tenor was singing “<cite>There’s a long,
long trail</cite>,” to the accompaniment of a wood-chopper’s
axe. It was part of the boys’ job
to see that the wood-boxes were kept full and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
the fires laid, and they usually elected to do
most of such chores before breakfast.</p>

<p>Anne had just time to get into the brown
middy costume like those the other girls wore,
which Tante had asked her to bring. She had
never put on anything like it before, and she
hated the material and color. But really she
looked very nice in the woodsy brown, with
her fair skin and bobbed hair.</p>

<p>“You look more like a Dryad than any of
us,” said Nancy approvingly when Anne appeared
for breakfast. And though Anne
wasn’t quite sure what a Dryad was, she
thought by Nancy’s tone that it must be a
nice sort of creature, and was pleased.</p>

<p>“It is queer how this brown makes you feel
like a part of the woods; doesn’t it?” she said.</p>

<p>“Now you are a Round Robin!” said Tante,
greeting her with a smile.</p>

<p>Breakfast was served on the veranda this
beautiful morning, instead of in the living
room where they had supped. The long board
on trestles, such as the pioneers used, was set
with plates and cups of granite ware; twelve
places, the sacred number. Tante poured the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
steaming chocolate, which Gilda had made,
at one end of the table. And this morning it
was the turn of Norma to serve at the other
end. Such delicious Belgian chocolate! Such
eggs and rice in Italian style as Norma had
prepared! Up and down went the plates from
hand to hand, like an endless chain. For
everybody was hungry as a bear. Doughboy
sat at a distance whining gently. He was
learning good puppy manners, the chief of
which is patience. But Patsy had disappeared
like a white flash as soon as Tante had let him
out, to get his own breakfast of field-mice.
Anne thought she had never tasted a better
breakfast.</p>

<p>“Now come on, dish-washers!” With much
ceremony an apron and clean dish towels were
handed to Anne, and a dish mop to Beverly;
and presently, with no very good grace on her
part, the Golden Girl was initiated into the
mysteries of a new job. Lucky it was that the
dishes were non-breakable! But Beverly chattered
while the process was going on, and the
open-air pantry was a merry place.</p>

<p>“How do you like it so far as you have gone,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
Anne?” asked Nancy, spoon in hand, poking
her head out of the kitchen door.</p>

<p>“It seems queer to me,” said Anne, remembering
to be sulky. “I can’t get used to there
being no servants.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t at first,” confessed Beverly.
“Down home even when we go for a few days
into the country we take Mammy and old Joe
and Mandy—&#8203;she’s their daughter. You just
ought to eat Mammy’s beaten biscuits and
fried chicken!”</p>

<p>“Are they black people?” asked Cicely
Vane.</p>

<p>“Yes, certainly,” drawled Beverly. “All
our servants are niggers.”</p>

<p>“Slaves, Beverly?” Freddie bounced suddenly
into the conversation in a way he had.
Everybody laughed except Freddie and his
Twin, who was busy scraping out an empty
jam-jar.</p>

<p>“Slaves!” cried Dick who was lugging in
a pailful of water. “We don’t have any slaves
in America, don’t you know that, Kid? Why,
we fought a war to—&#8203;” Dick’s voice trailed
off into silence, and for once that irrepressible
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
boy looked confused. For Nancy was making
frightful faces at him to remind him of the
forbidden subject. Once upon a time Beverly’s
grandfather had fought in that same war of
which he spoke; while Dick’s own grandfather
and Nancy’s had fought on the other
side, to free the slaves. Those three young
men had been college chums before the war.
Colonel Peyton, a gallant soldier, had died
for the cause he believed to be right. But the
Union and Liberty had triumphed. This was
the reason why the Northerners had agreed,
before Beverly came, not to mention this subject
while she was in camp.</p>

<p>“No, we haven’t any slaves in America,
Freddie,” said Tante gently, “though some
unfair things are still done, which will have
to be corrected. But I believe nearly everybody
in this land thinks alike about slavery
nowadays.”</p>

<p>“I reckon we do,” agreed Beverly. “You
needn’t mind talking about that war before
me, Nancy. I’m not sensitive about that. And
there’s only one Union now, isn’t there?”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I said about your Revolution,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
said Cicely. “We can talk about anything,
since we are all friendly, can’t we?”</p>

<p>“Of course we can!” nodded Tante. “That
is why it is so nice for different kinds of people
to get together, always.”</p>

<p>“Heia! Hoia!” called a shrill voice in the
woods. And down the path came hurrying
Nelly Sackett with a basket on her arm. She
had run most of the way from the Cove, and
was quite breathless.</p>

<p>“I thought I’d never get here before you
left!” she gasped. “Uncle Eph was so late
this morning. He’s been out hauling since
four o’clock, and has just got back. But here
are your lobsters, Tante. I boiled them myself
before I came. I’m glad you waited.”</p>

<p>“Dick wouldn’t have had a clam-bake without
you, Nelly,” said Tante. “And anyway,
we are not quite ready ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Dick has invited us all to a clam-bake,”
Nancy explained to Anne. “He has done his
studying ahead and has a free morning.”</p>

<p>“I hate clams,” answered Anne with a wry
face. “I think I won’t go to the clam-bake.”</p>

<p>“Oh, very well.” Nancy’s voice was cool.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
“But I think you will be sorry. We have
great fun at our picnics, and this one is to
be at a new place that Dick has discovered.
He and the Twins dug the clams yesterday
afternoon. Everybody is going; but you can
stay and keep house with Patsy, of course.”</p>

<p>Anne had no mind to be left alone in the
camp, even with Patsy. “Well, I suppose I
had better go with you,” she said, rather ungraciously.</p>

<p>“Where are your clams, Dick?” inquired
Tante, hailing him as he was starting down
to the boat with his two swaggering partners,
proud of their importance on this occasion.</p>

<p>“Oh, they’re all right,” said Dick mysteriously.
“I took good care of them yesterday.
Don’t worry; I didn’t leave them in the sun,
Tante. I was too clever for that. They are
where they’d like to be. Say, there are clams
enough at that place to feed the whole United
States, I do believe! And all as happy as
clams.”</p>

<p>Dick came from the far West, where his
father had a ranch. Everything about the sea
was wonderful to him, and he was never tired
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
of making new discoveries and serving up old
ones in a new dress.</p>

<p>Tante looked thoughtfully at Dick. “Of
course you know all about clam-bakes, Dick,”
she said. “I know how you helped Cap’n
Sackett last week. But—&#8203;hadn’t we better take
some luncheon besides? We never seem to
have too much food on our picnics; and perhaps
someone may not care for clams.”</p>

<p>“Anne doesn’t,” Norma volunteered.</p>

<p>“All right.” Dick looked a little disappointed.
“I thought we’d got everything
ready, and for once the girls needn’t bother.
There will be clams enough for everybody
who likes them. But if anyone is fussy—&#8203;all
right-o.”</p>

<p>“Lend a hand, girls,” said Tante. “We’ll
put up some sandwiches and eggs in a few
minutes.”</p>

<p>After the sandwiches were made, and while
they waited for the eggs to hard-boil, Cicely
went for the botany box which she always carried
to get “specimens”; and Nancy, hovering
about the living room, finally pounced on
something for which she was looking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
“What’s that pill-box for, Nancy?” queried
Eddie, the sharp-eyed.</p>

<p>“Well, if you must know, I’m going to hunt
for some fern-seed,” said Nancy rather shyly.
“You know to-night is Midsummer Eve. If
I find some fern-seed I am going to try to
become invisible.”</p>

<p>“Pooh!” cried Dick. “You are a goose,
Nancy!” But just then Patsy came scampering
up in a wide circle and jumped on Nancy’s
shoulder.</p>

<p>“You see, he knows!” she laughed. “He
wants to go with me. My fairy cat is full of
mischief to-day. He acts perfectly wild. He
knows it is Midsummer Eve, don’t you, Patsy?
But <em>you</em> can see fairies without fern-seed, I’m
sure.”</p>

<p>“You don’t really <span class="lock">believe——”</span> began Anne.
But she was interrupted by a shout from the
pier. “Hurry up, girls! Tide is just right!
Oh, Reddy!”</p>

<p>The Round Robin seized the baskets and
wraps and hurried down the slip where the
<i>Togo</i> was waiting. Tante and the Twins followed.
Doughboy made fourteen out of what
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
Norma called an “unlucky number.” Patsy
was not invited. He was too “temperamental,”
Dick declared. It was a crowded boatful.
But some of them sat on the floor and
some on the deck with their legs dangling
over. While the Twins and the pup chose
their favorite safe place in the tiny cabin, and
played at being stowaways.</p>

<p>It was a good hour’s run across the Bay and
up the entrance to a creek which Dick the
adventurous had discovered the week before.
As the boat entered the creek they saw the
waves rushing in a mad race to fill up the
little basin before it should be high water;
when they would as madly begin to rush out
again, after the excitable manner of tides.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t like this yesterday afternoon,”
said Dick proudly. “Why, it’s finer even than
I thought!”</p>

<p>“You came at low tide, you land-lubber,”
said Hugh. “You forget the difference the
tide makes in morning and afternoon.”</p>

<p>A queer look came over Dick’s face.
“That’s so,” he admitted. “But isn’t this
pretty?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
They agreed that it certainly was. Along
the tide-rapids great rocks were half-uncovered,
and on these were little brown heads
bobbing, smooth grey bodies rolling over and
over in ecstatic somersaults.</p>

<p>“Oh what is it? What is it?” cried the
Twins, popping out of the cabin when they
heard the girls exclaim.</p>

<p>“It’s baby seals,” said Hugh. “They are
doing their daily gymnastics, just as you do,
Kids. I expect it’s like the setting-up exercises
we had in the Army, eh, Victor?”</p>

<p>“I should call them sitting-down exercises,”
laughed Victor.</p>

<p>“Maybe they are just breakfast rolls,”
whispered Dick to Anne, who giggled, in spite
of Nancy’s growl of protest at such punning,
which the Club had agreed was not to be encouraged.</p>

<p>“What a place for a picnic!” cried Tante
as they passed a beautiful point where the
water was most rapid and where a group of
pines overhung the tide, “Can’t we stop here,
Dick?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” he assured her. “We have got
to have the clam-bake where the clams are.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
Wait till you see the beach! A great place
for a fire, as safe as snails. There’s the place,
just beyond that rock!”</p>

<p>Just beyond the rock the boat drew up to
the shore, a rock-strewn beach with a spit of
sand below, now covered by the high tide.
Hugh jumped out and held the boat for the
rest to descend. “Fine!” said he. “Where
are your clams, Reddy?”</p>

<p>Dick stood looking at the beach dubiously.
“Jiminy!” he exclaimed. “I forgot about the
tide! I dug the clams in the afternoon.”</p>

<p>“And we buried them in boxes down in the
sand,” volunteered Eddie.</p>

<p>“So they would be happy and damp until
picnic-time,” continued Freddie. “Where are
they now, Dick?”</p>

<p>“Where indeed!” cried Dick, mournfully.
“Still happy and damp, I guess.”</p>

<p>“<cite>There once was a boy from the West</cite>,”
chanted Nancy, beginning a limerick to celebrate
the affair in Club style:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>Who invited a Club as his guest,</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>To a clam-bake with pride;</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>But he left out the tide—</i>”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="unindent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
she hesitated for the last <span class="lock">line—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>And it played a low untidy jest!</i>”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">Dick finished the limerick himself, amid applause
and laughter. “How long will it be
before these clams are uncovered, Tante?” he
asked wistfully.</p>

<p>“It is high tide, now, and you can’t get at
them for nearly six hours,” she laughed.</p>

<p>Dick groaned. “Those inconsiderate old
tides of yours!” he said. “Now, out on the
prairie you know where you are when you
are there. The grass doesn’t go ebbing and
flowing down and up. It stays put. I like
solid ground, I do.”</p>

<p>“If you were only Moses now,” Nancy
teased him, “you could perhaps make the sea
open and let you get at the clams.”</p>

<p>“Or if you were Joshua you could do something
with the tide,” suggested Victor.</p>

<p>“If your fairies were any good you’d make
them get busy, Nancy,” retorted Dick. “But
as it is, I suppose we’ll just have to go home.”</p>

<p>“We’d all starve to death before six hours,”
agreed Victor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
“Oh, no, we have a luncheon,” laughed
Tante. “I had a vision that something like
this might happen. I brought bacon and the
coffee pot.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” shouted the Twins, who had
been looking very gloomy.</p>

<p>“I can fry bacon,” said Dick humbly, “if
I am a duffer about tides.”</p>

<p>“All right. Let’s build a fire in this safe
place, away from the trees and grass.”</p>

<p>They scattered about for fire-wood, and
presently they had a fine blaze under the
shelter of a big rock. “It is a beautiful place
for a picnic, Dick,” said Tante comfortingly.
“I am sure the Indians would have liked it
themselves for a camp.”</p>

<p>“You’re right,” said Dick. “Your coast
Indians did have some advantage over our
plain Indians, I’ll agree.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to stay here and live!” cried
Norma, clasping her hands in the dramatic
way she had.</p>

<p>“Oh, Norma! With only the clams to listen
to your music?” said Beverly.</p>

<p>“Well, somebody else has thought as Norma
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
does before now,” chuckled Dick. “I haven’t
shown all the wonders of my discovery yet.
Look, there’s sweet grass over in the bog behind
the bank there. And great tall sedges
for baskets. Then look at this bank itself!
See, it’s made out of clam-shells. I think the
Indians must have piled them here, long ago.”</p>

<p>“It’s an old Indian shell-heap, by Jove!”
exclaimed Hugh. “Reddy, you’ve made a
discovery after all. They must have been picnicking
here for generations before we were
born, by the size of this heap.”</p>

<p>“I thought it was a pretty good place for
a clam-bake,” said Dick modestly. “Even if
you don’t get your clams.”</p>

<p>While they waited for the coffee and bacon,
some of them fell to digging in the shell-heap.
They found only a few charred bones, that
looked like bird-bones, and some bits of
broken pottery. But even these gave them a
thrill. The Indians had been there! What
had they been doing? They could imagine
all sorts of things.</p>

<p>They could hardly bear to stop digging
even when the lunch call sounded. But how
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
good the coffee smelled and how delicious the
bacon tasted, as they sat around the bonfire
which had died down to glowing coals, and
munched the luncheon that was an after-thought
of Tante’s.</p>

<p>“I say!” cried Dick suddenly, with his
mouth full of bacon, “I wonder if we look
like the bands of Fijis who used to camp
here?’</p>

<p>“Fijis, you cowboy!” interrupted Hugh.
“They were proper Penobscots who owned
this part of the world.”</p>

<p>“How I’d like to see them sitting around
here, chucking their clam-shells one by one
onto that <span class="lock">heap——”</span></p>

<p>“Unless they were waiting for the tide to
go out, so they could get the clams,” tittered
Nancy. Dick shied a pebble at her and went
on with his word-picture.</p>

<p>“—Sitting around in a circle, gossiping about
that gay little massacre they had just pulled
off on the island over there. <em>Wow!</em>” Dick
gave a western war-whoop that made the girls
jump, and Norma covered her ears with horror.
Three crows arose protesting frantically
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
from some nook beyond the bank, and flapped
away inland, cawing bad luck to these invaders.</p>

<p>“Yes. I feel like an Indian myself!” volunteered
Beverly unexpectedly. “I had an ancestor
who was an Indian, you know. Pocahontas
was her name.”</p>

<p>“Pocahontas!” several voices echoed the
familiar name in wonder.</p>

<p>“I know about her!” chimed the Twins.
“She ran out and saved Captain Smith”—&#8203;“from
having his head cut off”—&#8203;“no, from being
roasted alive!”</p>

<p>“Now I remember,” said Tante, “your
mother’s family was very proud of being
descended from Captain Smith’s dusky friend,
Beverly. So are many of the old Virginian
families. Pocahontas was a king’s daughter.
Better still, she was a generous, noble, loyal
woman.”</p>

<p>“She married an Englishman named Rolfe,
and went to live in London,” added Cicely
Vane. “I have seen her grave in a church in
Gravesend.”</p>

<p>“She ought to have married Captain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
Smith,” said Norma, who was romantic.
“That would have been beautiful!”</p>

<p>“I reckon he was too old for her,” said
Beverly. “She called him her foster-father.
I don’t know what those first Virginians would
have done without Pocahontas to keep the
Indians friendly.”</p>

<p>“Say, isn’t it great to have a real Indian
here!” cried Dick. “I believe Beverly does
look a little red, doesn’t she?”</p>

<p>Beverly certainly turned red as they all
stared at her black hair and eyes, her fine nose
and high cheek-bones.</p>

<p>“I’d be proud to,” she said with dignity.
“I always liked the Indians. I think they
were treated mighty meanly by the white
folks, North and South. You talk about the
slaves!”</p>

<p>“Didn’t Indians scalp the white settlers?”
“And burn them and torture them?” The
Twins had been hearing tales from Cooper
told by Dick.</p>

<p>“Yes, they did,” admitted Beverly. “They
didn’t know any better. The white men
cheated them; and <em>they</em> knew better!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
“I’ve seen Indians around the Harbor sometimes,”
volunteered Nelly Sackett. “I didn’t
think much of them; shiftless-looking people,
with baskets to sell.”</p>

<p>Just then Cicely, who was facing away
from the others, caught Nancy’s arm. “Look
there!” she whispered pointing towards the
woods behind them.</p>

<p>Out of the shadow was creeping the strangest
figure. A bent old woman with a shawl
drawn over her head and shoulders was approaching
cautiously. Her grey hair escaped
in elf-locks, her cheeks were wrinkled like the
sand at low tide. She looked like a witch.
On her back was a great bundle of grass and
reeds, tied with a rope. In her hand was a
canoe paddle. Around her neck dangled a
chain of shells and beads. She wore moccasins
on her feet. She came toward the fire
with a grim, sulky look on her face, and her
little sunken eyes glanced from figure to figure
warily. Eddie and Freddie shrank close to
their mother’s skirts. Dick uttered a low
whistle.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
“You wanted to see an Indian,” whispered
Hugh, “Well, here she is!” Everybody sat
quite still, while the old crone came close to
the group.</p>

<p>“How!” she said at last in a low grunt.</p>

<p>“Good day,” answered Tante pleasantly.
“We are picnicking, as you see, in this pretty
place.”</p>

<p>“Heard war-whoop,” said the hag sullenly.
“Came to see who is on the land of my
fathers.” Her look was a challenge. The
party exchanged glances. Here was a strange
sequel to their talk!</p>

<p>“My father was Chief,” the old woman
drew herself up with dignity. “But I am all
there is left of my tribe. All this land was
ours,” she waved her paddle, apparently indicating
the whole shore of the bay. “The
white men took it from us. Now I have to
get grass for baskets where I can. That is
all for me to do.”</p>

<p>“Have you baskets to sell?” asked Tante
gently.</p>

<p>“Not here,” said the squaw. “But I make
them. Sometimes.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you will bring some to us we
would like to buy,” said Tante.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
“Mother!” Hugh tried to catch Tante’s
eyes with a warning shake of his head. But
the old woman answered Tante quickly.</p>

<p>“Yes. I will come. Next week. You live
over there?” she pointed in the right direction.
“I know.” She turned upon the young
men with a sudden snarl. “Why you make
war-whoop? Eh?”</p>

<p>Dick stammered. “Oh—&#8203;just for fun!” he
said. There was a black look in the old
woman’s eyes and she muttered something
below her breath. When as suddenly she
turned to go. Just then Freddie had an inspiring
thought.</p>

<p>“Beverly is an Indian, too!” he cried,
pointing at the girl. “Pocahontas was her
grandmother.”</p>

<p>“Hush!” Dick jerked Freddie into silence.</p>

<p>“Pocahontas?” the old squaw repeated the
name and eyed Beverly strangely. “My name
Sal Seguin.” They could not tell whether
or not she understood what Freddie had said.
Beverly herself had nothing to say.</p>

<p>“Ugh!” grunted the squaw at last. “White
Indian? Ugh!” Whether in disgust or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
pleasure, she shook her head once at Beverly.
Then without another word she disappeared
up the bank.</p>

<p>“Well, you young monkey!” said Hugh to
his little brother, “you did make a hit, didn’t
you?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mind,” said Beverly. “Why
should I? I will buy some baskets of the
poor old thing when she comes.” But Hugh
looked troubled. “I’m sorry she is coming
to Round Robin, Mother!” he said. “I don’t
like the old party’s looks. She doesn’t resemble
Beverly in the least!” and he made a low
bow to the Southerner.</p>

<p>“I’ve seen her before,” said Victor unexpectedly.
“Once, when I was picking strawberries
away over on the mountain. And once
when I landed to take a look at the boat-house
of Idlewild. She was prowling about there.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell Uncle Eph,” said Nelly. “He
won’t like that.”</p>

<p>“Is she your grandmother, Beverly?” suddenly
asked Eddie, who was much confused
by the previous remark of his twin.</p>

<p>“Will she join the Round Robin?” questioned
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
Freddie. At that there was a roar of
laughter. But Hugh capped the laugh with
a surprise.</p>

<p>“You girls needn’t laugh so hard,” said he.
“For once Freddie has said something not
altogether foolish. Some of the Indians had
a Round Robin of their own—&#8203;a ‘get together.’
The very first League of Nations was American
after all! The Five Nations of the Iroquois
were just that.”</p>

<p>“It has taken the world a good while to
catch up with those savages!” sighed Tante.</p>

<p>As the <i>Togo</i> chug-chugged noisily home
over the waves that afternoon, the girls spied
a birch canoe creeping silently along the
shore, propelled by experienced hands. And
the canoe was filled with bundles of green.</p>

<p>“I guess old Hoky-Poky had a profitable
day,” chuckled Dick.</p>

<p>“Well, so have we, in spite of clams,”
laughed Nancy. “Don’t you think so, Anne?”</p>

<p>“It has been very pleasant,” said Anne with
reserve as she stepped ashore. “But that old
woman made me nervous!”</p>

<h3>MIDSUMMER EVE</h3>


<p class="in_dropcap"><span class="flt_lt_std">“</span><span class="dropcap">O</span><span class="smcap">h</span> dear! I forgot my fern-seed!”
cried Nancy, as they reached Round
Robin. “Why didn’t you remind me,
Cicely, when we were getting the sweet grass?
The clam-bake was so exciting I quite forgot
about to-night.”</p>

<p>“I think it’s too early for fern-seed,” said
Cicely. “I haven’t seen any this year. But
if there is any to be found, surely it would
have been on that mysterious island, where
there seems to be pretty nearly everything
else.”</p>

<p>“Including witches,” laughed Dick.</p>

<p>“And a buried treasure of clams, Reddy,”
added Hugh.</p>

<p>“Perhaps Patsy will help me find some
fern-seed,” said Nancy, running up the path
to greet the stay-at-home. “He knows everything,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
I believe. He must be hungry for his
dinner—&#8203;Patsy, Patsy!” Nancy began to call
through the woods and to give the little shrill
whistle which the white cat always understood
and answered with his agreeable <cite>miaou</cite>.</p>

<p>But this time there was no answer. Patsy
did not come. Patsy was not to be found.
Not even the lure of lobster set appetizingly
out for his supper, nor the tempting sound of
a plate being scraped with a knife, which had
hitherto been an unfailing charm, recalled the
white kitten to his mistress.</p>

<p>What was to be done? The camp was in
an uproar. Never had Patsy been out at night.
It could not be allowed! The Twins went off
in one direction, the boys in others. The girls
scattered through woods and along the shore.
Nancy knew his favorite haunts. But Patsy
was not under the great beech tree where the
squirrels chattered. He was not cushioned in
the fragrant cedar-bushes over the wall in the
country of the field-mice. The dell under the
great pine told no news of him. Dick found
no print of little feet in the mud of the brook,
or in the sand of the bathing beach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
“Patsy! Patsy!” the woods rang with the
anxious cry; the evening bird-chorus seemed
to take it up with a mocking cadenza. For
they had no cause to love Patsy the prowler.</p>

<p>Finally the Camp gave him up for the
night. Nancy could hardly eat her supper
she was so worried. “I shall never see my
kitten again!” she wailed. “The foxes will
get him. Or he will tumble into the sea and
be drowned. Or he may stray off into the
deep woods and become a wild cat!”</p>

<p>“You needn’t worry,” soothed her mother.
“Patsy can take care of himself, like any native.
I’m sure of that.”</p>

<p>“But he never was out alone all night,”
lamented Nancy. “And this is Midsummer
Eve, of all times! Who knows what may happen
to him?”</p>

<p>“If Patsy is a fairy cat he will surely be
safe,” Cicely comforted her cousin. This
thought alone seemed to give Nancy a little
hope. She forgot all about fern-seed and the
charms she had intended to try on this magic
night. After supper she and Cicely retired
early to their tent in the Fairy Ring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
“What a fuss about a cat!” thought some
of the campers. But most of them were as
sorry as could be. For they loved the beautiful
Patsy.</p>

<p>“I sha’n’t sleep all night,” Nancy declared.</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” Cicely retorted, being a practical
common-sense person. “What good will
that do Patsy?”</p>

<p>“He might come home in the night,” said
Nancy dubiously.</p>

<p>“Well, if he does, he will be sure to tell
you,” said Cicely sleepily. And that was the
last she knew for a long time.</p>

<p>In the middle of the night, Cicely suddenly
opened her eyes and sat up in bed. The woods
outside were very still; but something was
moving in the tent.</p>

<p>“Nancy! Are you asleep?” whispered
Cicely. The moon shone in through the door-flap
and Cicely saw her cousin creeping mysteriously
about the floor. “What is the matter,
Nancy?” asked Cicely again.</p>

<p>“I’m trying to find my moccasins. I’m going
out to look for Patsy. I’m sure I can find
him in the moonlight,” Nancy answered in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
the same whisper. “I can’t stand it, Cicely!”</p>

<p>“But it’s the middle of the night!” Cicely’s
voice faltered. “Wait till morning, Nancy, do.”</p>

<p>“I can’t wait till morning,” Nancy said; and
Cicely knew she had been crying by the sound
of her voice. “I must go now.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll go too,” sighed Cicely, loyal,
though her heart balked at the idea of braving
this American wilderness in the dead of night.</p>

<p>The two girls slipped moccasins on their
bare feet and threw on their dressing-gowns;
then stole out of the tent into the moonlight,
which silvered everything with a magic touch.
The whole lit-up world looked wonderfully
beautiful. But the shadows were blacker than
ever, by the same charm. It did not seem like
the world they knew by day.</p>

<p>They crept carefully by the sleeping tents.
In the door of the third one stood a little
figure, white and fairy-like, looking out into
the woods with big eyes. “Why, it’s Anne
Poole!” Nancy whispered to Cicely who clung
to her hand. “She isn’t asleep, either!”</p>

<p>Anne joined them immediately. “You are
going to look for Patsy?” she said. “I thought
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
of doing that, too. But I wouldn’t have dared
go alone. May I come? He is such a darling
kitty!”</p>

<p>Nancy’s heart warmed to the Golden Girl.
“Ah, do!” she said. “Let’s get out into the
woods.” She felt the two girls shiver at the
words. But they were both bound to the adventure.
“I have a feeling that Patsy is in
the woods,” whispered Nancy.</p>

<p>Step by step, gingerly at first, then more
confidently as they grew accustomed to the
shadows, the three girls walked down the path
into the woods. “Patsy! Patsy!” called Nancy
in the littlest of voices, so as not to waken the
Camp. But nothing answered. To Anne,
fresh from the City, the stillness was almost
<em>loud</em>. She could hear her heart beat, <em>thump
thump</em>. In the woods were strange little
noises; the snapping of twigs, tiny rustles;
now and then a smothered chirp. The night
was not empty, but full of life that they could
not see. It gave a strange feeling to know
this. A hundred little eyes might be looking
at them this minute! A white cat is not easily
hidden. But Patsy did not appear.</p>

<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
“Let’s follow the brook down to the shore,”
whispered Nancy, squeezing Cicely’s hand
before she let it drop; for they had to go in
single file down the path. “If I don’t find
him there I will go back, I promise. Patsy
isn’t likely to cross the brook. Cats don’t like
running water, you know.”</p>

<p>“Neither do fairies!” murmured Cicely,</p>

<p>“I was thinking of that, too,” said Nancy.
But Anne Poole said: “He might be up in
the top of a tree.”</p>

<p>They crept through the silvery meadow,
along the little path that Patsy loved, for by
day it was full of pleasant crawling, creeping,
hopping things. The girls did not like to
think of this just now. They kept calling the
cat under their breath. But no Patsy answered.
No little white furry shape came
running to meet them, as he always did when
they chanced to pass his ambush.</p>

<p>“We shall see him right away if he is here,”
said Nancy eagerly, as they came out on the
shore, almost as bright as day in the moonlight.
Here the brook trickled down over the
rocks in a baby waterfall, a favorite spot of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
Patsy’s, where he was accustomed to vary his
hunting trips with a drink. But no Patsy was
there, and Nancy gave a groan. “I give up!”
she said.</p>

<p>Just then Cicely clutched her cousin’s arm
and drew her back behind a screen of elder
bushes. At the same moment Anne seized her
hand. “There is somebody under that tree!”
she whispered.</p>

<p>Sure enough. Under a drooping fir tree
a figure was crouched, her knees drawn up
to her chin. By her side was a bundle.</p>

<p>“It looks like a witch!” murmured Nancy.
And Cicely thought so too. But Anne knew
better. “It’s the Indian woman,” she said,
“Sal Seguin.”</p>

<p>“So it is!” The girls stared. And Anne had
a dreadful thought. “Maybe she has Patsy
in that bundle. Maybe she took him for his
beautiful fur!” But she did not tell this
thought to Nancy.</p>

<p>The old woman sat with her shawl drawn
over her head, apparently dozing. The girls
watched her, without moving—&#8203;five, perhaps
ten minutes. Then Sal Seguin stirred and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
glanced over her shoulder, almost as if she
felt someone was looking at her. Presently
she got up and went down to the water’s edge,
taking her bundle with her. They saw her
get into her canoe and paddle silently away
towards the Harbor. Her skilful strokes made
no sound.</p>

<p>“What do you suppose she was doing down
here?” asked Cicely, the first to speak.</p>

<p>“I hope she hasn’t got Patsy in that bundle!”
shivered Anne, unable to conceal her fear any
longer.</p>

<p>“Patsy! Oh, she couldn’t keep him in
there!” cried Nancy. “He is too full of life
and temper. You would know if you had
ever tried to put him in his traveling basket,
Anne.”</p>

<p>But Anne thought about that silky white
fur, and was not convinced.</p>

<p>They did not need the North Star, or the
bright Cassiopea’s Chair that stood over
the camp, to show them the way back. The
path was as plain as day. The thought of
that old woman behind them made them
glance over their shoulders now and then as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
they crept silently back up the hill, and perhaps
made them walk a little faster.</p>

<p>“I wish Beverly had been here,” said Nancy
when they were almost at the top of the slope.
“Perhaps she would have dared to speak to
the Indian and ask if she had seen Patsy.”</p>

<p>“Beverly is sound asleep,” said Anne.
“Nothing seems to disturb her. I tumbled
over my camp-stool, but she didn’t hear.”</p>

<p>“Thank you for coming,” said Nancy,
touching Anne’s hand as they parted at the
Fairy Ring.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry we didn’t find him,” said Anne
earnestly. “Maybe he will come yet.”</p>

<p>Nancy shook her head. “No,” she said, “I
haven’t any hope now.”</p>

<p>At breakfast the three girls came in looking
rather pale and very sleepy. Patsy was still
missing. They could hardly make the others
believe that they had really gone down the
pasture by moonlight. And when they told
about Sal Seguin, Dick insisted that they
must have been dreaming. But when they
mentioned Sal’s bundle, Hugh thought, as
Anne had done, about Patsy’s white fur. “I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
wish we had never seen that old Indian!” he
said.</p>

<p>Nancy had stolen away as soon as possible
to make a last despairing search for her pet.
And while the others were still talking about
the adventure of the night before, questioning
Cicely and Anne, as they wiped the breakfast
dishes, the Twins set up a shout.</p>

<p>“Here she is! Nancy has Patsy in her
arms.”</p>

<p>Breathless Nancy was toiling up the slope,
carrying the great ball of fluff. Her eyes were
shining and she laughed out loud with happiness
as she shouted “I’ve got him! I’ve got
him! The prodigal son!”</p>

<p>“Where did you find him, Nancy?” asked
Anne dropping her dish towel and running to
stroke the soft white fur of the blinking cat.</p>

<p>“Right in the middle of the path!” said she.
“I went down the same way we took last night,
to the shore. And there he lay just above the
spot where we saw Sal Seguin, under a little
juniper bush, right in the path. He just lay
there, too tired to move. He couldn’t drag
himself up the slope, but he answered when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
I called. Such a weary, worn, limp cat!
What do you suppose he had been doing to
get so tired? Where do you suppose he had
been all night?”</p>

<p class="center">“<i>Nobody knew where Kilmeny had been</i>”</p>

<p class="unindent">said Cicely, quoting the old ballad about the
girl who went to visit the Fairies.</p>

<p>“Did you go off with the Fairies, Patsy?”
asked Nancy, putting her face close to that
of the white cat.</p>

<p>“<cite>Mi-aou!</cite>” cried Patsy dolorously.</p>

<p>“I believe he did!” whispered Nancy to
Cicely Vane.</p>

<p>“I’m glad he’s safe,” said Anne, and the
white cat licked her cheek feebly. He was
almost too tired to be polite.</p>

<p>“Anyway, Sal Seguin didn’t carry him off,”
said Hugh. “That was what I suspected.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps she did, and he found his way
back,” suggested Anne. “That was what <em>I</em>
was afraid of, too.”</p>

<p>“I believe he was there all the time and
we didn’t see him,” declared Nancy. “I believe
he found the fern-seed that we missed,
ate it, and became invisible.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
Anyway, wherever he had been, Patsy slept
all that day on Nancy’s bed, the most exhausted
kitten ever seen. And he never told
the Club what adventures he had experienced
on Midsummer Eve.</p>

<p>Hugh and Victor met Captain Sackett that
morning when they went to the Harbor for
the mail, and they asked him if he had seen
an old Indian woman in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>The Captain scratched his head thoughtfully.
“Why yes,” said he, in his nasal drawl,
“did see an old woman in a shawl early this
mornin’, when I went haulin’. Yes, she had
a bundle in her canoe. I guess it was grass,
or herbs or somethin’. She’s quite a character.
But I haven’t seen her around for some time
till this mornin’. They say her tribe owned
this whole shore once. But not in my time,
nor in my father’s or grandfather’s, I guess.
The Indians were treated pretty mean, sometimes.”</p>

<p>“Where do you suppose she is now, Cap’n?”
queried Hugh. The Captain shrugged his
shoulders. “Who knows?” said he. “We
can’t keep tabs on everything that goes on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
along this coast full of islands. I guess I’ll
run up and take a look at Idlewild this afternoon.
Mr. Poole asked me to kinder keep
an eye on it. Say, has the little girl been up
there yet? Little Anne, I mean?”</p>

<p>The boys said No, she hadn’t had time yet.
The old man sighed. “I hope she’ll come to
see me too,” he said. “But I don’t want you
to tell her so.”</p>

<p>Hugh laughed. “Whatever you tell her,
she is likely to do the opposite thing,” he said.
“She’s a spoiled kid, Cap’n.”</p>

<p>Again the Captain sighed. “I guess she
is,” he said.</p>

<p>But Victor put in a good word for the newcomer.
“She’s awfully fond of animals, anyway,”
he said.</p>

<p>“A little cat!” laughed Hugh.</p>

<h3>THE PATCHWORK QUILT</h3>


<p class="in_dropcap"><span class="flt_lt_std">“</span><span class="dropcap">O</span><span class="smcap">h</span>, rain!” Norma lifted her head from
her pillow and groaned. “No swim
this morning, and Victor was just
teaching me that new stroke!” Norma hated
rain. Grey skies of New England always put
her into a bad temper. But her little Belgian
tent-mate was philosophical.</p>

<p>“We need ze rain for ze garden,” said
Gilda, “and for ze spring of wasser. Tante
said, if it not rains in July, it be bad for us,
the spring running dry.”</p>

<p>“I wonder how the Golden Girl likes living
in a damp tent!” thought Norma with a
grimace as she put on her wrinkled blouse and
brushed her unwrinkled hair. “It’s all very
well for you crinkly girls, Gilda. But do look
at me!” She stared in the small mirror
tragically.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
“Pooh!” said Gilda, who was learning a
few Americanisms. “Nobody care about
crinkles or wrinkles in a camp. Zat is what
Tante said. I like zat. Not so? Nobody
mind also leetle damps.”</p>

<p>“<em>Leetle damps!</em>” Anne Poole found it
more than a little damp as she picked her way
from rock to rock and around tiny lakes in
the path that led from the Fairy Ring to the
bungalow. She wondered what campers could
find to do on such a dismal day, and regretted
the comforts of Idlewild; the pool room,
the piano and victrola, the library with its
elaborately bound volumes. Anne had been
the only one who read books at Idlewild. Mr.
Poole had put them in as a part merely of
the library furnishings. So the library at
Idlewild had been Anne’s almost undisturbed
domain.</p>

<p>Though the Camp had turned out to be
quite tolerable during the week of sunny days,
with so many pleasant new things to do, Anne
wondered what in the world would keep her
from being bored by a deluge like this. But
to her amazement she found that <em>leetle damps</em>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
did not make much difference to the Round
Robin. To be sure, Dick was the only one
who went for the morning swim. He declared
it was drier in the salt water than on land.
To-day nobody was interested in going to pick
the wild strawberries which were growing
sweeter and ruddier every day in the meadows
back of the Fairy Ring. But the boys went
about looking like fishermen in their yellow
slickers and hats; for the mail had to be
fetched from the village and the milk from
Maguire’s farm, rain or shine. Cicely also
put on her mackintosh and went forth as usual
to “botanize.” You cannot keep an English
girl indoors just on account of rain. Presently
she returned, rosy-cheeked, to tell about the
lovely green rosettes that were unfolding on
the old spruce trees, and the wonderful color
in the deep woods. The surf on the rocks was
splendid too, she said. So everybody had to
run out to see; everybody but Patsy, who
looked very complacent and fluffy, when they
all returned dripping and draggled, but jolly.</p>

<p>But there was also plenty to do indoors that
kept the day from being really “dull.” Housework!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
Anne had never imagined that there
could be any fun in the kitchen! But as Tante
managed it, there was a regular competition
to see who should make the greatest hit, as
it came the turn of each girl to make a special
dish for breakfast or lunch or supper. And
a rainy day was a fine undistracted time for
the amateur cooks to get ahead with their
experiments in cake and pudding and bread,
fudge and cream peppermints.</p>

<p>A rainy day is good for basket-making, too;
for the grass of sedge or raffia is easier to work
when it is a little damp. Beverly spread herself
in a window-seat of the living room and
made great progress on her basket, while some
of the rest did their weekly mending, and
Norma read aloud. Nancy, however, retired
to a dry quiet corner of the bungalow loft, to
finish the fairy story which had been waiting
for a wet day to be “transplanted,” as she
called it. Then there were always letters to
write, if one had time.</p>

<p>But no one would have had time to spare
at Round Robin even during the Flood,
Nancy declared; with a pair of lively Twins,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
a brown dog and a white cat eager to be played
with. A girl who loved children and animals
had no excuse for being bored. Anne soon had
her hands full, when the children found what
wonderful things she could make with scissors
and paper. As a child left to her own resources
most of the time, Anne had learned
how to amuse herself in these simple ways.
The time went so fast that she was amazed
indeed when the tea-squad demanded her
help. Anne had already learned how to set
a table very nicely.</p>

<p>But the best part of a rainy day at camp—&#8203;like
the best part of many a speaker’s address—&#8203;is
the end of it. By evening everybody
in camp is tired of being busy and of moving
about. Everybody wants to keep still and be
amused.</p>

<p>After supper the boys heaped up a great
fire in the fire-place, and everyone drifted into
her favorite seat or onto his favorite rug or
cushion. Anne Poole retired into a dim
corner, where she could watch the faces in
the firelight without being watched herself.
She was still studying all these strangers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
critically, trying to see how they could possibly
be so different from the persons she had
hitherto known. And yet, as she had to confess
to herself, they were not so terrible after
all; not nearly so uncomfortable to live with
as she had feared they would be.</p>

<p>“Let’s pop some corn!” said Eddie Batchelder,
“mayn’t we, Mumsie?”</p>

<p>“Let’s tell stories,” suggested Norma.
“Everybody tell a story but me! You have
got one all ready, Nancy. I saw you writing
it this morning!”</p>

<p>“It’s only just transplanted. It isn’t blossomed
yet,” protested Nancy.</p>

<p>“You tell a story, Tante,” suggested Beverly.
“You haven’t told one this year.”</p>

<p>“If everybody were here,” said Tante.</p>

<p>“We’re all here,” said Anne, counting
around the circle, completed by Doughboy
and Patsy, curled up on the rugs.</p>

<p>“No. Nelly Sackett isn’t here,” several
voices cried. “But it is raining so hard I suppose
she won’t come.”</p>

<p>But just then there was a tap on the door,
and in pattered a little figure in rubber boots
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
and yellow slicker, with the Captain’s tarpaulin
hat drawn down over her curls which
were kinky with rain-drops. The Twins
rushed upon her and seized her umbrella, and
lantern, while Dick undertook to relieve her
of her rubber boots. Tante asked her if she
had not found it hard to keep the road on this
dark night, but Nelly said Oh, no; her feet
seemed to know the way. Whereupon Dick
began to chant his favorite poem, accenting it
as he pulled at the reluctant boots:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0a">‘My <i>feet</i> they haul me <i>round</i> the house,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">They <i>hoist</i> me up the <i>stairs</i>,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I <i>on</i>-ly have to <i>steer</i> them and</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">They <i>ride</i> me every<i>wheres</i>!</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“There you are, Miss Sackett. Dry as the
Ark!”</p>

<p>“I should think you-all would be afraid
to come alone, Nelly,” Beverly drawled.
“Why, I wouldn’t go out of the house alone
at noon; let alone a dark night in the rain!
Goodness! You are as bad as Nancy with her
moonlight rambles!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
Beverly’s mother had been Tante’s best
friend, when they were girls at school together.
But the children of those two schoolgirls
had been born in places where the customs
and conditions were so different that it
affected their whole lives. Tante’s children
were brought up never to be afraid to go anywhere,
ever. Freedom is always safest where
everyone has always been free. So she answered
Beverly—&#8203;“It’s different up North,
Beverly. At least, it always has been. Nelly
isn’t afraid of the dark, are you? But I wonder
you didn’t prefer your cosy home on such a
stormy night, my Dear.”</p>

<p>“I just had to come!” said Nelly. “Mother
and Uncle Eph have gone to meeting. I
guessed there would be stories here.”</p>

<p>“Stories! Stories!” clamored Eddie, who
was intently watching Freddie’s small success
with the corn-popper, now jiggling furiously.</p>

<p>“I think I shall have to bring out the Patchwork
Quilt, to illustrate my story,” said Tante.
Nancy and the Twins began to giggle, and
Hugh whistled. They alone knew what their
mother meant, for it was one of the family
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
jokes. Tante routed Norma and Beverly out
of one of the window seats in order to get
a rolled-up bundle from the interior; and
presently spread it out upon the floor in the
middle of the room. It was a patchwork quilt
of faded and old-fashioned calico squares, set
in a curious pattern; half-finished and with
ragged edges.</p>

<p>“This is our family fancy-work,” said
Tante. “I found it up in the garret of our
old house when I was a little girl. My mother
said as a tiny child she remembered it half
finished. She added a few squares herself in
a half-hearted way, she said. It must have
been begun by some girl in our family before
the Revolution, and has been growing gradually
ever since, square by square. But we are
not much of a fancy-work family, I fear. I
meant to finish the quilt before I was married.
But I never did; just as my mother never did.
So I gave it to Nancy. She works on it sometimes,
I believe.”</p>

<p>“I have made four squares in fifteen years!”
laughed Nancy, “those with my blue-and-white
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
gingham in. But it takes a lot of time.
I’d rather write stories.”</p>

<p>“As family fancy-work it seems likely to
last for a good many generations,” said Mrs.
Batchelder. “We use it now chiefly as a notebook
for stories.”</p>

<p>Seeing that Gilda looked puzzled, Freddie
explained by putting his thumb in the middle
of a black square nearest to him, as the quilt
lay spread on the floor. “<em>That</em> was a pirate
story,” he said. “And the blue one with stars
on it was about a sea-captain and a stowaway.
And the little mousy-grey square was the girl-Pilgrim
who came over in the <i>Mayflower</i> and
was Mother’s own ancestress.” A howl from
Eddie interrupted him.</p>

<p>“Freddie! You’re burning up the pop-corn!”
Sure enough. A dubious smell reminded
Freddie of his forgotten duty. The
pop-corn had hopped as fast as it could, when
he forgot to shake it; but it could not hop
fast enough to keep its feet from getting
scorched. Freddie looked ruefully at the
charred black men, and according to the rules
of the game, handed over the popper to Eddie,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
who took it importantly, and after refilling it
began to jiggle it with great care.</p>

<p>“Speaking of your little grey <i>Mayflower</i>
maid, Freddie,” said Tante, “she had just five
kernels of parched corn for her first American
meal, they say. I hope they weren’t so black
as these of yours, Sonny!” Tante was looking
at the quilt thoughtfully, and Norma called
out: “Story! Story!”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Tante, “I am thinking of another
sort of story—&#8203;not that one. Once upon
a time there was a great, big Patchwork Quilt,
3000 miles wide, made up of ever so many
little ‘squares’ of irregular shape. Not one of
them was really square; any more than are
the ‘squares’ in our cities. Every square was
itself made up of all sorts of little patches and
pieces and scraps. Some of the pieces came
from the North where it is cold; and some
from the South where it is hot. They were
all different—&#8203;no two just alike in color or material
or quality. Some came from the East
with its strange wonder and brightness; and
some were of the West, rough and serviceable.
There were fine and precious squares, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
others of flimsy or even shoddy goods; many
were coarse, and some were worn pretty thin.
But pieced together and backed and quilted,
sewed with unbreakable thread, they became
strong and durable. It made a firm, warm
quilt without any rips or holes. The chief
beauty of the quilt was this <em>wholeness</em>, this
keeping together in an unbroken pattern of
squares.”</p>

<p>Some of the group were looking puzzled.
“What does Mother mean, Hugh?” asked
Freddie who was leaning against his big
brother’s knee, critically watching his Twin’s
efforts with the pop-corn. Gilda listened
eagerly for Hugh’s answer. “America!” he
whispered under his breath, and he looked
across at Victor, who nodded, squaring his
shoulders. They had both fought for America,
and loved her name.</p>

<p>“If this quilt had been all of one kind of
material,” Tante went on, “it would have been
old-fashioned, like the other quilts, some of
which were very beautiful, but badly worn.
Some of them were tattered and rent into bits.
You can see them on the map, painted one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
solid color; but that doesn’t show how frayed
they are at the edges where they have been
torn or snipped away by cruel shears.”</p>

<p>“‘<cite>Shears</cite>’ means wars,” explained Victor
under his breath. “Cruel they are! The old
quilts are the old kingdoms of Europe,
Freddie.”</p>

<p>“It’s a funny kind of story!” said Eddie
dubiously, agitating the popper, and not to
be distracted by Freddie’s whispers.</p>

<p>“But this quilt I’m telling about,” went on
Tante, “this new quilt was made up of pieces
out of nearly all the old ones; fresh, bright
pieces, most of them, the best and strongest
part of the many-colored counterpanes of the
world. Every one of these pieces was needed
to make up the new pattern, sewed with the
thread of old tradition, law and order. Every
patch had its own place in the great getting-together,
named a Union.”</p>

<p>“Why, the United States is a great Round
Robin, isn’t it, Mumsie?” cried Nancy. “I
never thought of it before.”</p>

<p>“So it is!” nodded Victor. “And some day
we shall have a still bigger League, when all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
the nations of the world get together and make
their squares fit into a beautiful pattern, without
losing each its own shape.”</p>

<p>“That’s it!” Tante nodded. “The whole
world will not be <em>free</em> until it is <em>bound together</em>;
bound by something besides cables
and railroads and wireless.”</p>

<p>Gilda was bending over the quilt studying
it eagerly. “Zere is a square of <i lang="fr">La Belgique</i>!”
she cried, pointing to a patch of black, red,
and yellow. “Hurrah for brave Belgium!”
cried Dick. “We need her pluck that saved
the world.”</p>

<p>“And there is a bit of Italy,” said Norma,
laying a finger on a cornerwise patch of red
and green, with white between.</p>

<p>“Mother had a dress of that pretty print,”
interpolated Tante. “How Italy does bring
brightness everywhere! And there is the tricolor
of France. The blue and red are a little
faded, Victor, because France with her fine
gifts has been here in our quilt a long time;
among the very first. French sailors, Norse
and Icelandic, all came to America before the
Spanish named it and the English mapped it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
“My grandmother was French,” said Nelly
Sackett. “She came from Canada.”</p>

<p>“I am part Spanish,” said Dick. “I guess
that’s why I am so much interested in pirates.
I’m a regular Patchwork Quilt myself! I’m
part Irish and part Dutch and part Swedish,
too. They all had a hand in building
America.”</p>

<p>“You’re an old Hyphen!” laughed Hugh.
“It’s the Hyphens who make most of the
trouble in this country. They think more
about the land from which their ancestors
came than about this one that claims their
whole allegiance.”</p>

<p>“Hyphen yourself!” retorted Dick. “You
think a lot more about ancestors than I do.
I’m a hundred percent. American, I am;
though I do come from the opposite side of
the Continent, 3000 miles from the Hub. And
anyone who says I’m not had better look out!
If I had been a few years older I’d have been
a war-veteran too, with a brass star to make
me feel smart. Or maybe I’d have been a
dead hero, with a medal!”</p>

<p>Tante hastened to soothe Dick’s troubled
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
spirit, saying that Hugh was only joking when
he spoke of the hyphen. For nearly everybody
in this country has some foreign blood
in his veins, of which he ought to be proud,
unless it makes him the less American in
loyalty. Then to change the subject Tante
pointed out in the quilt the colors that might
represent Poland with its gifts of music; the
blue and white of Greece, with its tradition
of beauty. In one square she saw the faith
of the Jews, loyal to what they held true and
pure; in another was Armenian patience and
skill of hand. This purple suggested the
heather of Scotland, thrift and grit and
honesty on which America had builded firm
structures. A bright pink square she declared
must be from Bohemia, the home of fairy-tales.
And so on. What would America do
without all these gifts from the older lands?</p>

<p>“This looks like a green English meadow,”
said Cicely picking out a vivid square.</p>

<p>“What are <em>we</em>, Mother?” asked Nancy
presently, “we who are just Yankees and
nothing else, since we left off being English
one Fourth of July?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
“I think the tiny patch of greenish-grey
represents us, Nancy,” laughed her mother.
“English with a difference. There isn’t so
conspicuously much of us in the patchwork,
for the brighter colors crowd close about us.
But you see a lot of squares have grey in the
background, with polka dots and checks,
stripes, figures, invisible brocade, and changeable
effects. The Yankee spirit is pretty well
scattered over the old quilt from border to
border. We furnished a good deal of the
thread that sewed the squares together, too.</p>

<p>“Well, my part of the story is done,” finished
Tante. “You have all helped to tell it.
But the quilt is full of many more thrilling
tales, I know.”</p>

<p>“Dick is crazy to tell one,” said Beverly
mischievously.</p>

<p>“Well, I know a story that might be a western
square of the quilt,” said Dick modestly. “It’s
very short and it’s very true. Father told
it to me.”</p>

<p>“Let’s hear it, Dick,” said Tante. And
looking sly, Dick began.</p>

<p>“Well, you know my father’s grandfather
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
and grandmother started out West from New
England early in the game. I guess they got
tired of hearing Hugh’s great-grandfather tell
about the doings of <em>his</em> great-grandfather who
came over in the <i>Mayflower</i>! Well, they
traveled the way the pioneers did, in a prairie
schooner, you know—&#8203;a big wagon drawn by
oxen, with all their furniture and ploughs and
pigs and chickens aboard; besides a lot of
kids. That’s how they went all the way across
the country; because there weren’t any railroads,
of course. They had a terrible time.
There were wolves and Indians, and floods
on the great rivers. One time the food gave
out. And they couldn’t find water for days.
Some of them were taken sick with a fever,
and the littlest baby died. They buried him
out in the middle of the prairie, and nobody
knows where his grave is to this day. But
I think it was somewhere near Chicago,
Anne.”</p>

<p>“Well?” said Nancy. “Is that all the
story?”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that enough?” asked Dick pretending
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
to be hurt. “It’s the history of my patriotic
ancestors.”</p>

<p>“But what’s the point?” asked Victor poking
Reddy in the ribs.</p>

<p>“The point is,” said Dick, getting to his feet
ready to make a hasty retreat to his tent—&#8203;“that
I am descended from that little kid who
died!”</p>

<p>The uproar that followed this anti-climax
ended the story-telling for the evening. Nelly
Sackett refused to let Reddy go home with
her after such a fake ending to a real story.
Instead it was Victor who had that honor, and
the two departed under one umbrella to the
tune of “<cite>Seeing Nelly Home</cite>,” chorused by
the Round Robin and derisive Dick.</p>

<h3>SAL SEGUIN</h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">It</span> was a week before Sal Seguin kept her
promise, or threat, to bring her baskets to
Round Robin.</p>

<p>One hot afternoon Anne Poole had retired
to the Fairy Ring, presumably to write letters.
Beverly, who tried to give Anne full possession
of the tent as often as she wished it, was
swinging in the Gloucester hammock on the
piazza, with Nancy and Gilda. They were
all lazily watching Cicely who was arranging
the flowers she had gathered that morning in
her daily “prowl.”</p>

<p>“You just ought to see the flowers in the
South, Cicely,” said Beverly. “The flower
markets are the prettiest places! And our
flowers are big, bright luscious ones; not like
these pale little Yankee things. We have
something blooming all the year round.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
“And further south are waxy magnolias,
and Cherokee roses and azaleas and trumpet-vines—&#8203;oh,
they are lovely!” said Nancy.</p>

<p>“But I think these twin-flowers are wonderful,”
said Cicely, holding up a spray of the
creeper with a pair of tiny pink bells on the
end. “We don’t have this in England. I followed
a delicious odor like heliotrope in the
woods, and came upon a whole pink rug of
this fairy-flower!”</p>

<p>“You are a real flower detective,” said
Nancy. “A botanical Sherlock Holmes.”</p>

<p>“I love flowers!” cried Gilda clasping her
hands. “Everybody of Belge loved ze
flowers. In my city we had one great garden
in ze middle of ze railroad station, under ze
glass roof. And along ze canals of Bruges
it was like one long garden, sliding down into
ze wasser. But war spoiled all ze gardens,
and ze people who made zem.” Her face
grew sad.</p>

<p>It was then that they spied the figure of
the old Indian woman approaching, with a
great bag slung over her shoulder and a basket
under one arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
“How?” she grunted, coming up to the
piazza and setting down her burden. “You
buy basket of old Sal? You promised.” Gilda
was nearest her.</p>

<p>“I haven’t money,” said Gilda. “I’m very
poor.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t much, either,” laughed Nancy.
“But I’ll see. And I’ll call the other girls.”
She disappeared to the Fairy Ring.</p>

<p>“Let me see the baskets,” said Beverly. “I
like baskets. I am trying to make one for
my mother, but it is very hard.”</p>

<p>Sal looked sharply at her. “You Indian?”
she asked. Beverly laughed.</p>

<p>“You haven’t forgotten, have you?” she
said. “Pocahontas lived more than two hundred
years ago. I am her descendant; part
Indian.”</p>

<p>Sal grunted. “Part Indian, all same Indian.
I give you baskets cheap.” And she
began to spread out her wares on the floor;
many hued baskets, moccasins, birch-bark
frames and knick-knacks.</p>

<p>“I will show you my basket,” said Beverly
running into the cabin and bringing out a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
rather unsymmetrical shape which she was
making of sweet-grass braid. Sal looked at it
critically. “I show you better,” she said. And
with strong, deft fingers she taught Beverly
how to shape and strengthen the basket with
a bit of willow to hold it firm. Not contented
with this, Sal began a new basket of sweet
grass, and showed Beverly how to start right.</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you!” drawled Beverly, with
the pretty manner that made everyone like
her. “Now I must buy a nice basket of you,
to show Mother how it really should be done.”
She had already chosen one of the more expensive
baskets, with some bows and arrows
for the Twins, and a little canoe for a small
brother at home; when up came Nancy with
Norma and Anne. The latter was in a rather
bad humor.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know you were dressing,” Nancy
was apologizing. “I thought you might like
to get some baskets.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care about these baskets,” grumbled
Anne, glancing scornfully at the display on
the piazza floor. “Idlewild is full of them.
They are quite ordinary; ugly colors. These
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
traveling Indians never have anything decent.
We can get a better choice in the store at
home. Oh!”—&#8203;she stooped and picked up a
pair of moccasins in soft natural-grey sealskin—&#8203;“These
are really quite pretty. How much
are they?”</p>

<p>The squaw eyed her sulkily, then snatched
back the moccasins with what would have been
very bad manners in one who knew better.
“Not for sale!” she cried. “You live in the
big house over there?” she pointed towards
the south, towards Idlewild.</p>

<p>“Yes; my father Mr. Poole’s house is
there,” assented Anne, wondering how the
squaw knew.</p>

<p>“Land of my tribe!” muttered Sal Seguin.
“Bad man stole it off my people. Your father,
bad man, got it off them. No luck to him!
He drove me off his place one time. Would
not let his people buy!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know,” Anne murmured aside to
Norma. “We were having a party last year.
They said an Indian wanted to come in, but
of course Father would not let her bother
everybody.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
“Your father bad man!” repeated Sal Seguin.
“I not forget!”</p>

<p>Anne shrugged her shoulders airily. “Well,
if that is all, I may as well go back and finish
dressing. <em>Thank</em> you for calling me, Nancy!”
and she walked away with a disagreeable
swing.</p>

<p>“Humph!” grunted the old Indian with a
malicious leer.</p>

<p>Each of the girls bought something. Even
Gilda, whose pocket-money was very scarce
indeed, purchased a tiny thimble-case for
Tante. Norma departed with a photograph
frame. Beverly had piled up quite a mound
of souvenirs, saying they would make lovely
Christmas presents. Sal packed the remaining
things back in her sack. Last of all she
took up the grey moccasins which Anne had
liked. Then suddenly she turned to Beverly.
“I give them to you,” she said. “You speak
kind. You real Indian; big heart! Not like
daughter of bad man.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you!” Beverly took the little
moccasins. “They are very pretty,” she said.
“But I shall pay you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
“No pay. Humph!” The old woman
waved her hand in the air with a grand gesture.
“My fathers owned all the land beyond
and behind, rich Chiefs. My father big
Chief. I am the last. But the white people
go on forever. And some are bad. Not you!
Humph!”</p>

<p>Without another word she shouldered her
pack and walked away. Down the path
she disappeared. But presently through the
branches of the trees they saw her paddling
swiftly towards the South.</p>

<p>“I wonder where she lives?” mused
Beverly. “Poor old thing!”</p>

<p>“Probably in the Indian Reservation at
Oldtown,” said Nancy.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t she good to give me these moccasins?”
said Beverly, stroking the silvery skins
thoughtfully. “I suppose it wouldn’t be fair
to give them to Anne? But I can loan them
to her while I’m here. I don’t want them.
We don’t use such warm things in Virginia.
They are meant for you cold-blooded
Northerners.”</p>

<p>“They have plenty of moccasins further
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
south, if you don’t have them in Virginia,
Beverly,” said Nancy with a twinkle. “I’ve
never been in your famous State, but I know
Florida a little. And I had a funny time
there once with a famous naturalist, about a
moccasin. I don’t think I ought to tell his
name, he is so <em>very</em> famous!”</p>

<p>“Let’s hear the story, and perhaps we can
guess,” said Beverly.</p>

<p>“Was it when you were at that wonderful
house-party with Tante?” asked Cicely. “Tell
us about it, Nancy.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Nancy chuckling. “You see,
this famous naturalist was visiting there too;
and the boys and girls loved to tease the old
dear, who was awfully nice to us and didn’t
seem to mind our jokes a bit. He was just
crazy to see a moccasin-snake—&#8203;that’s the very
poisonous and very dangerous kind, you know.
He wanted to put him in a book.”</p>

<p>“Ugh!” shivered Gilda, much as old Sal
might have done. “Put um in a book? What
for zere, Nancy? I zink, in a trap is better!”</p>

<p>“Zey are safe in a book,” laughed Nancy,
imitating Gilda’s accent. “But not when zey
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
crawl in ze grass, and squish in ze mud, and
drop wiggling off ze trees!”</p>

<p>“Stop, Nancy!” shrieked the girls in chorus.</p>

<p>Nancy went on with the tale. “Uncle John
had the worst luck! We boys and girls had
all managed to see a moccasin somewhere.
But though he got up early and kept awake
late, hunting along the river and in under the
live oaks, never a moccasin did he see.</p>

<p>“Well, we were kind children; and we put
our heads together to get the old man what
he wanted. He must see that moccasin! So
we fixed up a nice little scene for him. I
went up to my bedroom and got one of my
Indian moccasins—&#8203;maybe Sal Seguin had
made it. Anyway, I had brought it from here.
It was a New England moccasin. And it was
brownish, with grey fur around its neck.
After dinner Jack—&#8203;he was one of the boys—&#8203;took
the thing down to the river bank and
planted it under a bush, pinning it down with
a forked stick, the way they catch snakes.
Then two of us girls joined him carelessly.
For we saw Uncle John sitting on the piazza
worrying because he hadn’t yet seen any moccasin.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
Pretty soon both of us began to scream.
Ethel ran away as if she were frightened to
death, and I raced up to the house calling
‘Uncle John! Uncle John! Oh, do come quick
and see the moccasin! Jack has him pinned
down. He’s quite safe. Quick!’</p>

<p>“You see, I didn’t say a word that wasn’t
true. I was very careful about that. I knew
how Uncle John hated nature-fakirs.”</p>

<p>“Nancy, what is a nature-fakir?” asked
Cicely, who often had to have American
words translated for her.</p>

<p>“A nature-fakir? Why, he’s somebody who
mixes up fact and fancy without calling it
a fairy-story,” explained Nancy. “Uncle John
says that isn’t playing fair.”</p>

<p>“I should call those unfairy stories,” said
Cicely. But the Club warned her with a howl
that she was talking too much like Dick.</p>

<p>“Well,” went on Nancy after this interruption
had been punished, “when Uncle John
heard that word <em>moccasin</em> he scampered down
the walk to the riverbank faster than any old
man you ever saw! And as he ran he cried
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
‘Don’t hurt him, Jack! Don’t bruise him! I
want to see that moccasin alive, just as he is.’</p>

<p>“‘I’ve got him!’ cried Jack. ‘I’m holding
him. I won’t hurt him. But hurry up!’</p>

<p>“As Uncle John drew near he caught sight
of the grey fur around the top of the moccasin,
for he has sharp eyes. ‘Gracious!’ said
he, ‘That’s the queerest-looking snake I ever
saw!’ Then as he came close he guessed what
it was. ‘It’s a joke of that Nancy!’ he shouted.
‘Wait till I catch her, the good-for-nothing
girl!’ And he chased me all the way back
to the house. But he couldn’t catch me!”
Nancy giggled at the memory of that chase.</p>

<p>“You ought to have sent him a pair of
moccasins to keep his feet warm,” suggested
Beverly. “I think you owed it to him, Nancy.
It was mean to tease a great man so!”</p>

<p>“It would have been mean if he had
minded,” said Nancy. “But he <em>was</em> a great
man every way; and he acted like a dear
about it. He loved to tell this story on himself.
I made a limerick about it. This is the
way it goes:”</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>“I know who it was!” shouted Beverly.
“You’ve told now! <em>That</em> great man! How
dared you do it, Nancy? I call it disrespectful!”</p>

<p>“Sh!” warned Nancy. “You mustn’t say
his name, if the others can’t guess. Dear Uncle
John! It must have been the rebellious southern
air that led me into mischief,” she answered
Beverly’s reproach.</p>

<p>“What are you girls quarreling about?” demanded
Dick Reed, swinging himself onto
the piazza. “What’s the joke?”</p>

<p>“Only one of Nancy’s foolish stories, in
which she is always the heroine,” drawled
Beverly.</p>

<p>“And a poem, which I do not understand,”
said the bewildered Gilda.</p>

<p>“Nobody ever understands a poet, except
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
himself. Isn’t that so, Nancy?” Dick teased
her.</p>

<p>“Nancy’s poetry is usually very easy to
understand,” said Cicely loyally. “But this
has some kind of joke in it. They say we
English aren’t quick at jokes.”</p>

<p>“I say,” said Dick interrupting, “the old
witch has been here, hasn’t she?” He pointed
at the pile of baskets at Beverly’s feet. “I saw
her down along the shore. She looked cross
enough and was muttering at a great rate.
I’d hate to have her down on me.”</p>

<p>“She is down on Anne, then,” said Beverly,
and told Dick what had happened.</p>

<p>“Well, you couldn’t blame Anne for feeling
hurt at having her father called a bad man,”
Dick defended the absent lady, like a knight-errant.
“Is he a bad man, Nancy?”</p>

<p>“How do I know?” said she. “I only know
people don’t like him here. And I think he
is not very kind to Anne; though she won’t
say so.”</p>

<p>“Sh! Here comes Anne!” whispered
Beverly. “Goodness, what style!” Anne appeared
from her tent, white-gowned, with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
gloves on her hands, and a parasol over her
head.</p>

<p>“Anne! I never saw a parasol in camp before!”
exclaimed Nancy. “And as for gloves,—&#8203;we
use them only in the vegetable garden,
shaking hands with the weeds.”</p>

<p>Anne deigned no reply to this sally.
“Norma said she would like to go with me
to see Idlewild this afternoon,” she said. “If
anyone else wants to come, I should be glad
to have you. I haven’t the keys, but we can
see a good deal outside the house.”</p>

<p>“But why these clothes?” gasped Nancy.</p>

<p>“I haven’t dressed for a week,” said Anne.
“I like to feel respectable once in a while.
Khaki doesn’t seem to belong at Idlewild. But
of course, if <em>you</em> don’t <span class="lock">mind——”</span></p>

<p>“Cap’n Sackett has the keys,” volunteered
Dick. “You might call on him.”</p>

<p>“Why, I’d like to go with you, Anne,” said
Cicely.</p>

<p>“So would I,” agreed Nancy and Beverly.</p>

<p>“And I,” added Gilda. “Here comes
Norma.”</p>

<p>Dick had an errand elsewhere. “I say!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
he whispered to Nancy, as the girls started
for the walk along the shore, “the Golden Girl
is going to get a surprise when she sees the
palace of the king her father!”</p>

<p>“Why, Dick?” asked Nancy. But Reddy
would not tell her.</p>

<h3>IDLEWILD</h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> first part of the way to Idlewild was
unfamiliar to Anne. Apparently she
had never walked far on the foot-path
around her father’s place. But as they approached
the end of the mile walk she grew
more animated. She remembered this point
of rocks, that tree, this cliff above the surf.
And when finally they came to the solid and
substantial wall which Mr. Poole had built
to separate his land from mere pasture, her
spirits rose greatly.</p>

<p>They climbed the pretty stile, “quite English,”
as Cicely said. Then Anne became the
Golden Girl once more, and began to show
the others about with an air of importance.</p>

<p>“These are the steps leading down to the
landing pier where Father usually keeps our
yacht,” she announced. “It’s no use going
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
down now, for the <i>Day Dream</i> isn’t in commission
this summer. This is the path to the
house. Isn’t it pretty, and easy to walk on,
it’s so nicely gravelled? See these beautiful
lawns! Father had the underbrush cleared
away and all tidied up. It cost a great deal
of money to start the sods, I heard him say.
Grass doesn’t like to grow on these rocks. But
he made it!”</p>

<p>“I think the wild tangle that we have passed
through is lovely,” said Cicely. “The underbrush
in New England is always a surprise
to me. We have lawns and trimmed trees in
England, of course. But we don’t see anything
wild like this.”</p>

<p>“Well, anybody can have a wild place
around here,” said Anne loftily. “Father
made this to be different. He copied somebody’s
place in Italy, I believe.”</p>

<p>“Yes, here’s an Italian pergola,” said
Norma. “And here’s a brick terrace. That’s
Italian too.”</p>

<p>There was a neglected tennis-court on the
lawn in front of the garage; and a sunken
garden, dried up and weedy. Anne looked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
at the flower-beds in surprise and some mortification.</p>

<p>“Why, how badly the garden looks!” she
exclaimed. “I thought Father always left
somebody to take care of the place until we
came again. But this looks as if nobody had
been near it since last summer.”</p>

<p>“It would take more than one man to keep
this big place in order,” said Cicely, who knew
about such things.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! Father employed three gardeners,”
said Anne, “and I don’t know how
many other men. I shall write him they aren’t
doing their duty. He will be very angry when
he knows. He can’t bear to see things out
of order.” Anne remembered more than one
exhibition of her father’s bad temper.</p>

<p>They were walking along the neat paths on
top of the cliff, in front of the great house
with its shuttered windows. The dead leaves
of last fall lay brown on the unraked lawns.
The wind had blown and torn the bushes here
and there. Everything looked forlorn and
unhappy. Anne grew more and more uneasy,
even as she pointed out the elaborate arrangements
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
of the place; the big garage, the water
tower, the lighting plant, the ice house, the
stable where her pony had been kept. Anne
did not know where he was now; perhaps in
Canada.</p>

<p>Presently they came to a low house with
wire pens adjacent. “This was the chicken
house,” said Anne. “We had pigeons and
rabbits, too. But the hutches are all empty.
Why, I wonder what has become of my white
rabbit? I had a lovely one named Plon.
Those dreadful servants have not taken care
of him!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps your father did not intend to keep
the place,” suggested Norma. “It looks—&#8203;well,
finished.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure he is coming down another summer,”
said Anne quickly. “It is only this
year he had to go away on business, he said.
It is the fault of the caretakers that the place
looks so badly.”</p>

<p>“Why, here is one leetle garden growing
nicely as can be!” cried Gilda, who had been
exploring by herself. “See, ze roses are all
in ze bud!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
“It is my own little garden!” cried Anne,
running to where Gilda stood. “I was afraid
to visit it, for fear it would be dead. I have
taken care of it all myself for ever so many
summers, ever since I was a tiny tot. I never
let anyone else weed it. And here is my herb
garden behind it; but that does not look so
well.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know you ever worked, Anne,”
said Nancy innocently, “even in a garden.”</p>

<p>“Work in a garden is only play,” said Anne.</p>

<p>“We will remember that!” chorused the
Round Robin. “Our vegetable garden never
gets half enough attention,” explained Nancy.
“We’ll introduce you to-morrow!” But Anne
was bending over the little plot she called her
garden, fingering the plants lovingly. Rosebushes,
mignonette, poppies, morning glories,
sweet william, iris were all in bud, nicely
weeded and trimmed. It was like a little oasis
in a desert of desolation.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand why this looks so well,
when everything else is neglected,” said Anne,
greatly puzzled. “It certainly seems as if
somebody had been tending it. Whoever it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
is, I wish he had looked after my pets too.
I’m afraid the poor things are all dead!”</p>

<p>“Maybe zey went away to be wild rabbits
again,” suggested Gilda sympathetically.
“Zere are wild rabbits here. I saw one yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Oh, did you? What was he like?” Anne
was all eagerness. But it was a little brown
bunny which Gilda had spied in the woods;
not the big white Plon.</p>

<p>The girls went up on the piazza of the great
house, trying to imagine how the interior
would look when the windows and doors were
open. “The hammocks always hung here,”
explained Anne. “And we had afternoon tea
in this corner when the screens were up. This
is the glassed-in breakfast room. You can’t
see it now because of the shutters. My rooms
are above it, there. I have three all to myself,
done in pale blue. Not much like camp, is
it?” She smiled complacently. “Though I
do like a tent, really,” she confessed. “I shall
ask father to build me a sleeping-porch next
season.”</p>

<p>“But don’t you like trees close by, as we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
have at Round Robin?” asked Nancy. “Mr.
Poole must have cut off a lot of trees from
this place. It seems bare to me.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Anne, “they cut off the trees
to make a better view. I remember Father
said so. I had forgotten it was quite so bare
around the house.” She looked about with
new eyes, used to the sifted sun and shade of
the intimate woods. “But what a wonderful
thing it was that Father could turn this
scraggy old New England pasture into such
a foreign-looking place! Our friends who
visited here called Father a magician.”</p>

<p>“Plain American is good enough for me!”
said Nancy. “I like it the way we have at
Round Robin, cosy and simple.”</p>

<p>“Well!” said Anne abruptly. “Let’s not
stay any longer. It makes me homesick to
see the place so.” She did indeed look disappointed
and sad. The place was not so imposing
as she had remembered. The girls
were not so greatly impressed as she had hoped
they would be.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what!” suggested Nancy.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
“Let’s go and see Nelly’s home. It’s only a
little way from here.”</p>

<p>“All right!” the Club was ready. But Anne
objected. “Oh! I’m too tired,” she said. “I’d
rather go right home.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come on! It’s such a little way,” urged
Nancy. “Cap’n Sackett wants to see you, I
know, Anne. He is always talking about you,
and how you used to come down often when
you were a tiny tot.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you care to go there any more?”
asked Norma bluntly. “I should, if anybody
wanted to see me so much.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” Anne hesitated. “When
I was little there seemed plenty of time. But
now it is different. There is always so much
going on at Idlewild—&#8203;riding and driving and
tennis and golf and company and yachting
parties. But I did go down once every summer.
Father made me.”</p>

<p>“Well, to-day will make at least once this
summer; and there’s no time like the present,”
urged Nancy. “Nelly will never forgive us
if she hears we were so near and did not go
a little further to see her. But if you like, you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
could wait here for us to pick you up on the
way back, Anne.”</p>

<p>“No, I will go too,” said Anne, who had
no mind to wait in the lonesomeness of Idlewild.</p>

<p>It was less than half a mile from Idlewild
to the Cove, across Mr. Poole’s well laid-out
golf links. This too showed the lack of care.
Already the trespassing weeds and lawless
grasses were taking advantage of the generous
July sun to riot and grow bold. The unkempt
green was really no less beautiful; but it
shocked Anne.</p>

<p>“I shall write Father to-night,” she repeated.
“It is dreadful!”</p>

<h3>NELLY SACKETT’S HOME</h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Over</span> another stile in the handsome wall
clambered the Round Robin, and the
girls found themselves in simple pasture-land
once more. This was land that
Captain Sackett would not sell to the rich man
who had wanted to own and enclose for his
sole pleasure the whole shore line from the
Harbor to Camp Round Robin. The little path
was almost lost in a tangle of blueberry bushes,
juniper and sweet fern, where the wild roses
were already in bud. But it led inevitably
to the Cove at the head of which stood the
old white house.</p>

<p>“What rough walking!” grumbled Anne,
holding up her white skirt and picking her
way between the briars. “Not much like
Father’s nice path.”</p>

<p>“It is the old Indian trail,” said Nancy.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
“Once it was all like this along the shore to
our place and beyond, so Mother says. That
was fifteen years ago, before any of us were
born.”</p>

<p>They spied Captain Sackett at a distance,
hammering at some new lobster-pots on the
beach in front of his house. His motor-boat
was anchored a little way out in the water,
and an old dory was drawn up on the beach.
“Let’s give the yell and surprise him,” said
Nancy.</p>

<p>“Heia! Hoia! Together! Round Robin!”
hailed the Club; Anne alone standing silent.
The old man straightened up, glanced about,
then whirled his hat in the air, shouting in
return:</p>

<p>“Hi there! Hi yourselves!”</p>

<p>All the girls but Anne raced up and danced
around him in a merry ring, hand in hand.</p>

<p>“Glad to see ye, glad to see ye!” he cried.
“Hello! There’s another one comin’ along.
Why, it’s Anne, ain’t it? I thought so!” A
glow of pleasure lit up his weather-beaten
face as Anne walked slowly in his direction,
and he advanced to take her not-too-ready
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
hand. “Why, how you’ve grown!” he said
delightedly. “And how fine you’re dressed!
Comin’ to make a call? Come right up to
the house, the hull of ye, and see Aunt Polly.
She and Nelly will be tickled to death to see
ye all.”</p>

<p>Nothing loth, the Club raced up the path
to the house with its trim lilac bushes on either
side of the door. Aunt Polly, plump and
motherly, was waiting for them, with Nelly
grinning over her shoulder.</p>

<p>“Come in! Come in!” said Aunt Polly
hospitably. “I’m right glad to see you. I’ve
been expecting you before this; but we know
how fast the time goes with young folks who
have so many nice things to do. Now, isn’t
it lucky I’ve just made some fresh cookies?
Nelly, you run into the pantry and bring a
pan of those cookies for the girls.”</p>

<p>Off scampered Nelly. And the girls followed
Aunt Polly through the spick-and-span
kitchen into the sitting room. It was a dear
little room. About the walls were old-fashioned
pictures of ships and shipwrecks.
On the mantel and what-nots were curious
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
shells and branches of coral, bits of carving
and queer treasures that the Captain had
picked up in his many voyages. Great bowls
of nasturtiums stood on the table and on the
top of the little parlor organ. There were
shelves of books between the windows, and
books lay about here and there. The walls
looked pleased, like the walls of a room in
which people read aloud.</p>

<p>“Here’s Anne, Polly!” said Cap’n Sackett,
calling his sister’s attention to the last of the
party who came in while the cookies were being
passed. He spoke gravely, and Aunt
Polly as gravely replied, turning to greet the
girl.</p>

<p>“Why Anne! How do you do, my dear?”
Nelly’s mother gazed at Anne as the old man
had done, with an eagerness that seemed to
embarrass her. “Well, how you have grown
this year!” continued Aunt Polly softly. “I
suppose I ought to call you Miss Poole,
now you are almost a young lady. But it
doesn’t come natural.”</p>

<p>“It really doesn’t matter what you call me,”
said Anne pertly. “I’m just a member of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
Round Robin this summer. Next summer it
will be different, perhaps.”</p>

<p>“What do you hear from your <span class="lock">F——,</span> from
Mr. Poole?” Cap’n Sackett questioned Anne,
while Polly and Nelly chattered to the others.
Anne bit her lip; but she answered almost
in spite of herself, it seemed.</p>

<p>“I haven’t heard from Father since I came.
He’s a poor correspondent, Mother says.”</p>

<p>“I guess I know that!” The old man shook
his head understandingly. “I’ve known him
nearly twenty years, Anne, for better, for
worse. How’s the baby?”</p>

<p>“He was well when I left Chicago,” answered
Anne shortly.</p>

<p>“Father’s in Canady, ain’t he?” inquired
the Captain. “Not comin’ down this summer,
no?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Anne. “And I shall write him
about Idlewild. He will be very angry when
he hears how badly the place looks.”</p>

<p>The Captain glanced at Anne out of the
corner of his eye. “Why, I’ve been up there
now and again,” he said slowly. “He told me
to keep an eye on the place, and I have. I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
thought it looked all right enough, for an
empty place—&#8203;kinder lonesome, of course; but
you can’t help that.” He saw the girl wince
at the word “lonesome.”</p>

<p>“It looks horrid,” insisted Anne.</p>

<p>“It’s a big barn of a place,” agreed the Captain.
“Not so homy as this old shack of mine,
now I’ve got Nelly and her mother here. Say,
you used to like the Cove here pretty well
once, Anne. Do you remember?”</p>

<p>Anne glanced around the simple room with
the ornaments that she remembered very well
from visits in her earliest childhood. “It
seems a long time ago,” she said. The old
man sighed.</p>

<p>“A long time ago!” he repeated. “Though
you aren’t so very old, Anne. I wish you’d
come oftener, like you used to do. Maybe you
will this summer, now you are with these
other folks? They are real neighborly.”</p>

<p>Anne hastened to change the subject. “The
only thing that looks right at Idlewild is my
little garden,” she said. “It really seems as
if somebody had been taking care of it.” The
Captain grinned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
“Well, I kept an eye on that too,” he confessed.
“Nelly helped me weed it. We two
couldn’t manage the whole big garden, of
course. But we thought the little one looked
so lonesome there by itself, we had to fix it
up. It does look good, don’t it? Those mignonettes
are comin’ on fine!”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you!” said Anne simply. “It
was nice of Nelly to take that trouble for my
garden.”</p>

<p>Nelly came over to where Anne was sitting
and smiled at her rather wistfully. “Don’t
you want to come out and see the rabbits?”
she asked. “They are in a pen behind the
house.”</p>

<p>“Rabbits!” Anne exclaimed. “I love rabbits.”</p>

<p>“You know these rabbits, too,” smiled
Nelly. “They belonged to Mr. Poole. Uncle
saved them.” The three were making their
way around to the back of the house where
the animals lived.</p>

<p>“When the critters were sold,” explained
the Captain rubbing his hands, “I just bought
in these rabbits, as well as the chickens. I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
thought it would please you, Anne, and I liked
the little fellers, too. The big white one is
right cute.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s Plon!” cried Anne, delighted.
“You dear old thing! I am so glad you are
safe!” She took the rabbit up in her arms
and hugged him rapturously.</p>

<p>“He knows you, all right!” chuckled the
Captain. “You can take him back with you,
if you want to.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, I am afraid he would be lonesome,”
sighed Anne.</p>

<p>“Then you must come often to see him
here,” said Nelly Sackett eagerly.</p>

<p>“Yes. I will.” Anne hugged the rabbit
closer, while she smiled upon the old man and
his niece for the first time that day.</p>

<p>“I wish I could have saved the pony for
you too, Anne,” said the Captain. “But he
cost too much. I’m not rich, you know.”</p>

<p>“The pony was growing old and cross,”
confided Anne. “I didn’t love him as I do
Plon. But why were the animals sold? I
don’t understand!”</p>

<p>The Captain shook his head. “Orders,” he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
said, “Mr. Poole’s orders. His agent sold
everything about the place, furniture and all.”</p>

<p>“The furniture!” Anne stared. “Then the
house is quite bare inside?”</p>

<p>The Captain nodded. The other girls who
had been roaming about the house examining
the Captain’s treasures now came running out
to ask questions. “Oh, Captain! What’s this
big tooth with pictures on it?” asked Beverly
holding up an engraved ivory cone.</p>

<p>“That’s a whale’s tooth,” said the Captain,
“tattooed out in China. And that’s a swordfish’s
sword,” he answered Gilda’s question
about the strange natural weapon she was carrying.</p>

<p>“Oh, won’t you tell about this, please?”
begged Norma, holding out a bottle in which
was a tiny ship with all sails set. She had
found it on the mantel-shelf among the other
treasures.</p>

<p>“Yes, tell them about that ship, Eph,” urged
Aunt Polly who had followed them into the
door-yard. “That is a good story.”</p>

<p>“How did ze tall ship go into ze leetle bottle?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
asked Gilda in amazement. “I don’t
know!”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, Cap’n!” pleaded Nancy. “Do tell
that story. Have you heard it, Anne?”</p>

<p>Anne shook her head. “I’ve heard a lot
of the Captain’s stories, but never that one,”
she said.</p>

<p>“Oh, I dunno about tellin’ <em>that</em> story,” protested
the Captain. “It wa’n’t anything.”</p>

<p>“That was a copy of the ship he saved,”
interpolated Aunt Polly. “They had it made
for him, those Portygees. Ain’t it cute? I
don’t see how they ever got it into the bottle,
as the little foreign girl says.”</p>

<p>“Did he save a ship?” asked Anne with
round eyes, hugging the rabbit.</p>

<p>“More than one!” chuckled Aunt Polly.
“Ask anybody in this county. But that was
the best one. Eph was a real hero, everybody
says. He’s a real hero still, for that matter,
isn’t he, Nelly? Once a hero, always a hero,
that’s what I say!”</p>

<p>“Oh nonsense, Polly!” exclaimed Cap’n
Sackett testily. “You hadn’t ought to talk
such foolishness to these girls. Now young
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
Victor Lanfranc, down to your camp, he is
a real hero. He got wounded ’way up in the
air over the German lines, that young Frenchy
did. He bombed the factory where they made
their wicked guns; and he got a medal for it.
I admire that lad! I never got nothin’ but
a salt water duckin’. He! He!” Captain
Sackett gave a merry little chuckle.</p>

<p>“You ought to have had a medal,” insisted
Aunt Polly.</p>

<p>“Oh, you must tell us about it!” begged the
girls in chorus. “Heia! Hoia!”</p>

<p>“Now, please begin,” commanded Nancy.</p>

<p>They all sat down on the grass, Anne still
clasping Plon in her arms, and listened breathless
to the Captain’s story, which he told while
he whittled at a wooden peg.</p>

<h3>A REAL HERO</h3>


<p class="in_dropcap"><span class="flt_lt_std">“</span><span class="dropcap">I</span> <span class="smcap">don’t</span> think it’s worth tellin’,” protested
the Captain again. But as they
would not take no for an answer, he began
in his droll way.</p>

<p>“It happened before any of you were born,”
said he, “when I was captain of a little
schooner named <i>The Anna</i>. That was my
wife’s name, and my little daughter’s after
her. I had just been married, and was home
for a little vacation. That summer there was
a lot of terrible storms off this coast. If you’ve
ever seen a storm on this bay, girls, you can
guess what it’s like in the winter. Our rocks
are cruel hard and sly. They hide under the
waves there like giants’ teeth ready to chew
up the little boats.</p>

<p>“Well, there was a little schooner from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
Portygal that had got off her course, and the
storm blew her in here. She beat in to what
looked like a safe harbor out of the storm.
But out there on the Washers she struck the
reef, hard. In a jiffy the schooner was all
stove up into kindlin’s; but the men managed
to cling to a spar and drifted onto what seemed
to them a little island. They climbed up into
what looked like safety, though it was mighty
damp, for it was low tide at the time. But
that island is one of the Washers, and is
covered at high tide with ten foot of roarin’
green water. They was all pretty nigh
drownded already; and while they clung to
the rocks two more of the men were swept
away by big waves. They didn’t guess it, but
full tide was bound to get ’em all.</p>

<p>“Now, I was lookin’ out of this front window
with my spyglass, same as I always did
in a storm, when I was ashore. And I sighted
through the rain somethin’ black out on the
Washers. ‘Gorry! It’s men!’ I says to Anna.
‘There’s men out on the Washers! Must have
been a wreck. Must try to get ’em off in the
double-quick. ’Course, they <em>had</em> to be got
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
off,’” the Captain paused, already on the
defence.</p>

<p>“That was just like Eph!” Aunt Polly interrupted.
“Somebody had to do it; so he did.
He never waited for ‘George’ or anybody else
to do it. He tried to get some fellers to go
out with him; but they said No good in that
storm. It was sure drowning. They told him
he would have to give it up. But Eph he
would go! Not even Anna could keep him,
and they just married! She told me afterwards
how she begged and prayed him to stay
for her sake. But he said for her sake he
couldn’t let ’em drown; she’d never forget it
if he did. Eph’s so obstinate!” Aunt Polly
gazed at the Captain with affectionate admiration.
He pretended to be angry at her interruption.</p>

<p>“You let me tell this here story, will ye?”
he growled, whittling with redoubled vigor.
“Well, you see, as Polly says, somebody had
to go out and get those men. Of course I went.
Hadn’t I been the first one to see their danger?
The Lord had showed ’em to me. Ye can’t
wish His job onto anyone else. Ye must take
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
it yourself, when He hands it to ye. That is
all there is to it.</p>

<p>“Well, I put the old dory into the surf;
I kinder thought she’d see me through. The
fellers helped me—&#8203;that was tough work! I
thought we’d never get over the rollers. But
well—&#8203;I did get out to the rocks somehow,
and somehow I brought back four of the men—&#8203;four
Portygees who couldn’t speak a word
of English. Tickledest men I ever saw! For
I didn’t get to ’em a mite too soon. The waves
were creepin’ mighty close. Two of the poor
chaps had been washed off already. I always
felt kind of guilty about those two. Seems
as if I had hurried a little more; if I hadn’t
stopped to put on my son’wester and boots,
I might have saved ’em all. Those two
drownded men kind of ha’nt me, sometimes.”</p>

<p>“The idea!” again interpolated Aunt Polly.
“It was a sheer miracle you saved any of them
and got back alive. Everybody said so.”</p>

<p>The Captain calmly ignored her remark
and went on with a chuckle. “You oughter
seen this shore the next few days! The Portygee
schooner was freighted with oranges
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
and lemons and pineapples and olives and oil,—&#8203;queer
things like that. The rocks were
covered with yaller splotches and dabs, like
paint the artist-folks daub all over the cliffs
in the summer time. I guess they get mad
with their paint-boxes and tip ’em over out
of spite! Well, the waves were all shiny with
oil, and we had pies for dinner and lemonade,
till we were sick of ’em. Anna and I had
our first taste of olives. I’ll never forget what
a face she made at the queer flavor of ’em!
It was funny to hear the Portygees tryin’ to
thank us in their lingo and make us a present
of all the stuff we could save from the sea.
They were so grateful.”</p>

<p>“I should think they might have been!”
cried Norma enthusiastically. “Why, you’d
risked your life for them, like a story-book
hero!”</p>

<p>“They lived on Eph for a week,” added
Aunt Polly. “I don’t see where he stowed
them all. Foreigners too! I guess he was
good to them; just as good as if they had been
American.”</p>

<p>“Well, why shouldn’t I be?” asked the Captain.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
“They were humans, weren’t they?
Everybody’s neighbors in this world. For all
I know, those Portygees are Americans now.
Two of ’em said they were goin’ to settle in
the West some day.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Captain! I am so proud of you!”
Beverly’s eyes shone.</p>

<p>“Nonsense! It wa’n’t anything, I tell ye!”
blustered Cap’n Sackett, turning red. “It was
about that boat in the bottle you wanted to
hear? Well it is kinder cute, ain’t it? One
of the Portygee sailors sent it to me after he
got back to his own land. He carved the little
boat himself, and made all the sails and riggin’.
But I dunno how ever he got it into
that little narrow-necked bottle. It beats me!
Those furriners are cuter than we about some
things.”</p>

<p>“Eph was about dead when they all got
ashore,” Aunt Polly added to the story. “He
never was so husky afterwards. Anna wrote
me she had to rub him half the night to get
him limbered up. But he kept telling her
to look after the poor foreign sailors, who
couldn’t speak a word of English. Eph
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
seemed to think that was the pitifulest part
of it all.”</p>

<p>“Wal, I guess it was!” drawled the Captain.
“Everybody ought to learn to talk English—&#8203;eh,
Gilda?”</p>

<p>The girls listened open-mouthed to the
story which none of them had ever heard before.
It was not an unusual tale, perhaps; they
may have read something like it. But to think
that this was <em>true</em>, and that it had happened
right out on these very rocks which they could
see this minute, and that this old man, their
friend, was the real hero of it! Anne, sitting
with the rabbit in her lap, soon forgot even
Plon. As the story went on her cheeks grew
red and her eyes grew bright. It seemed as
if she were acting out the story, too. When
Cap’n Sackett stopped abruptly, she gave a
gasp.</p>

<p>“Oh!” she cried. “How splendid! What
next?”</p>

<p>The Captain glanced at her as if he were
more pleased by this word than by anything
else. Was it just because she was the Golden
Girl? That did not seem like Cap’n Sackett.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
“You like to hear about the sea, don’t ye,
Anne?” he said gently. “Used to when
ye were a little kid. You ask ‘what next?’
Why, there wasn’t any ‘next’ to speak of. I
just went on sailin’, till I got sick. Then I
lay-to a spell, here in the house my father
built. He was a captain too; and so were
his father and grandfather before him. But
when a man gets rheumatiz he can’t command
a ship any more. Too much depends on the
captain. But I could ketch fish off and on.
That’s what I did for a good many years before
we had motor-boats to make it easier. It
hasn’t been a kid-glove life, Anne. But I have
kinder liked it.”</p>

<p>“What a pity you didn’t have a lot of little
boys and girls to tell stories to!” exclaimed
Norma with warm enthusiasm. “You make
it so interesting.” The Captain’s face clouded.</p>

<p>“Ain’t it a pity?” he said. “I did have one
little girl named Anna.” He gulped and then
said with a gentle smile, “And now there’s
Nelly,” he laid his hand affectionately on his
niece’s red curls.</p>

<p>“He’s been so good to us,” said Aunt Polly.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
“After Nelly’s father died three years ago,
he brought Nelly and me right home and
treated us as if we were his own.”</p>

<p>“Well, ain’t ye my own?” chuckled Cap’n
Sackett. “My own brother’s wife and child.
I dunno how I ever got along without ye.
You make this a home once more.” Thereupon
Aunt Polly scuttled away into the next
room, wiping her eyes on a corner of her
apron.</p>

<p>“Let’s go home by the road; it’s shorter,”
suggested Nancy, when they had said good-bye.
“We don’t need to go through Mr.
Poole’s place at all. He mightn’t like us to
trespass,” she smiled mischievously at Anne.</p>

<p>“Yes. Let’s go by the road,” agreed Anne.
“I don’t want to see Idlewild again this summer.
It is too lonesome.”</p>

<p>“I suppose I oughtn’t to have said that
about the Captain’s children,” said Norma
contritely. “Is there something very sad
about it, Nancy? I could have cut out my
tongue as soon as I had spoken. I’m always
saying the wrong thing!”</p>

<p>“Mamma says the Captain has had the saddest
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
life,” answered Nancy, “though he is so
cheerful, the most popular man in the township.
All his neighbors are always coming to
him with their troubles. You see, his daughter
and her husband were killed in an automobile
accident. It nearly broke his heart, for he
worshiped Anna. Then, the very next spring,
his own wife died. His brother and Aunt
Polly were living twenty miles away at the
time. He went on a long voyage; but that
was the last. He must have been all alone
for years. Wasn’t it sad?”</p>

<p>“He is an old dear!” declared Beverly. “He
seems to admire you, Anne. You ought to be
mighty pleased about it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m jealous!” cried Norma. “He will
never like me again.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be silly,” said Anne stiffly, and she
walked on ahead.</p>

<p>“He is wonderful!” was Cicely’s comment.
“He seems like the kind of big brave men
who founded America. I’m glad they are not
all in books. Nelly ought to be proud of her
uncle.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
“I guess she is,” said Nancy. “Only it’s not
the Yankee way to show it. I know.”</p>

<p>Anne walked on in silence; then she said
rather suddenly. “It’s queer! When he told
that story, I felt as if I had been there! It
must be wonderful to be a sailor. If I were
a man, that’s what I’d like to be.” This
sounded so little like the Golden Girl that
they all stared, then began to laugh.</p>

<p>“It’s because your father is a fancy yachtsman,”
said Nancy.</p>

<p>Anne looked at her over her shoulder.
“That isn’t the same thing, as you very well
know!” she declared. “Yachting is only a
game. You don’t have to be brave to do that
kind of thing. Somebody else does it for you.
Captain Sackett is different! He is the first
real hero I ever met; but he is just a common
man.”</p>

<p>“Mother says the biggest people in the
world have seemed simple men,” said Nancy
gravely. “Even Abraham Lincoln. Or even
the Greatest One of all.”</p>

<h3>THE EAGLE’S NEST</h3>


<p class="drop-cap">A <span class="smcap">fortnight</span> went by, and “the Tenderfeet,”
as Dick called the newer
campers, were growing used to camp
ways which had seemed queer and hard to
some of them at first. In all that time Anne
received no letter from her father. But one
day Tante did. She did not tell Anne this,
but put the letter in her apron pocket and
carried it to her favorite spot in the woods
to read by herself.</p>

<p>The letter was dated from a place in
Canada, and was signed by Mr. Poole. There
were some mysterious words among the plain
business matters mentioned in the letter. Mr.
Poole was writing about the money to be paid
for Anne’s summer expenses at the camp. “It
is a crisis with me,” he wrote. “You’ll understand
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
before long, I guess. I’ll be glad if
you will keep Anne as long as you can; then
I’ll have to do something, I don’t know what.
I can’t write to her, and my wife is all bound
up in our little baby, of course. You can’t
expect much of her. She isn’t very strong,
and of course Baby has first claim on us. That
word ‘<em>claim</em>’ makes me sick anyway! I’ve got
to harden my heart to everybody. You’ll soon
know what I mean.”</p>

<p>“What can the man mean?” thought Tante,
fingering this strange letter. “Harden his
heart! I should say it must be hard as granite
already! Poor little Anne. She is worrying
because she does not hear from him. But
letters like this don’t make one happy. We
must help her to have as good a time as possible
this summer.”</p>

<p>Tante went straight to the Fairy Ring
where Anne was making up a second cot bed,
her own being already properly finished. Her
eyes were red. And when Tante appeared in
the tent opening Anne hastily brushed a tear
with her khaki sleeve. “I’m making Beverly’s
bed,” she said, trying to appear careless. “She
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
made mine yesterday, without my asking her.
Beverly is very nice.”</p>

<p>“I hear you girls are going for a climb
to-day,” said Tante smiling approval. “It’s
a lovely day for it, and the Eagle’s Nest is
not very far.”</p>

<p>“I can climb all right,” said Anne. “But
I’ve got letters to write. Tante, why do you
suppose I don’t hear from my father?” she
cried suddenly, showing what the trouble was
that made her eyes red and the tears ready
to start.</p>

<p>“There might be many reasons,” said Tante
soothingly. “But whatever they are, you
mustn’t worry. You must get all the sunshine
you can out of this golden summer. You had
better go with the girls on this nice trip.”</p>

<p>“Something has happened to Father,” said
Anne uneasily. “I have suspected for some
time that things weren’t going right. He
seems so different. It isn’t like him to sell
the animals, even Plon and the old pony.”</p>

<p>“You must be a brave girl,” said Tante,
putting her arms around Anne’s shoulders. “If
anything happens, we will all stand by, Anne.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
Friends do help when they get together as
we try to do at Round Robin.”</p>

<p>“The girls are all right,” said Anne. “If
you say so, I will go with them. And I should
like to see an eagle’s nest.”</p>

<p>“That’s right! I have put up a luncheon
for you already,” said Tante. “I was sure
you would go.”</p>

<p>Anne straightened her shoulders and hurried
away to get ready for the climb. Presently
she joined the brown group in broad
hats and with business-like knapsacks strapped
to their shoulders, who were gathered at the
back of the camp. The girls were going alone
this once. For Hugh and Victor were away
for a three-days’ camping trip in the deep
woods, and Dick, excused from studies for
that time, was acting as Camp Protector in
their absence.</p>

<p>“Be sure you keep together and follow your
leader,” Tante charged them as she waved
good-bye.</p>

<p>“Who is the leader?” asked Anne of Beverly
Peyton, who was waiting for her at the end
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
of the line. “Why, Nelly Sackett, of course.
She knows the way better than anybody.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know she was going!” said Anne,
hanging back. She felt not unfriendly to
Nelly. But she could not get used to the idea
of this freckled country girl as a leader in <em>her
Club</em>. Anne liked to be a leader herself, or
to choose whom she would follow.</p>

<p>“Tante would not let us go without Nelly,”
said Beverly. “None of the others have been
over the trail this season, not even Nancy. But
Tante said we might go if we would be very
careful.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Anne, reluctantly following
in Beverly’s footsteps. She was ashamed
to explain how she felt, and why she hated
to be at the end of the procession that Nelly
led.</p>

<p>The eagle’s nest was on the small mountain
that lay at the back of the camp, about two
miles distant. The nest was a secret that Captain
Sackett had discovered years before,
when he was a little boy. How long it had
been there before his time nobody knew. But
every year two old eagles came to the nest,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
and used it for a nursery, far above the sea
and beyond the homes of men; shut in by
thick woods and the bold rocks of the mountain.
This was just the time when Captain
Sackett had seen a baby eagle there last year;
and the Club was eager to visit the nest now,
while the Veterans were away, hoping to
have something to tell them on their return.
For it is not many persons who have seen an
eagle on its nest.</p>

<p>It was a wild walk through thick woods
with no road; only a narrow trail made in
years past by wood-cutters, and since used by
campers and summer people at long intervals.
For Captain Sackett had kept his secret well,
telling only those friends who could be trusted
not to hurt or harry the faithful eagles’ well-hidden
nursery.</p>

<p>The trail followed at first the bed of a
brook. It was an easy climb, under shady
trees, and the girls went merrily without stopping
to rest. Then, where a cairn of brook-pebbles
marked a change of direction, Nelly
led them at right angles along a narrow footpath
between low bushes and under trees that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
had not been trimmed for years. This was
the path to the nest. The trees were marked
by old “blazes” or notches made to show the
path to keen eyes, and the girls had fun in
trying to see who would be the first to spy
each blaze. Nelly was ahead of the others,
and had this advantage. But Cicely’s eyes
were quick; perhaps because she had studied
flowers closely and also because she liked to
draw and sketch out of doors, as so many English
girls do.</p>

<p>It was very exciting to lose the trail for a
moment, then to find it again plainly marked
some yards ahead, when you thought it gone
forever. It seemed like a live thing, playing
at hide and seek with them. But the girls
knew that the only safe way was for the last
girl in line to stay close by the last blaze discovered,
until the leader should reach the next
blaze. That is an old woods’ rule. And the
second rule is <cite>Keep Together</cite>—&#8203;which was
also the Club motto.</p>

<p>By and by the path ceased to climb. They
had come out upon flat ground covered with
very tall old spruce trees, many of them
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
draped with grey moss, like bearded giants.
Beverly and Anne were chatting at the end
of the line, and the others were a bit ahead,
when Nelly turned and signed to them to be
quiet. “<em>Sh!</em>” she cautioned with her finger
on her lip. “We mustn’t talk now!” Anne
was annoyed.</p>

<p>“Why can’t I talk?” said she. “She needn’t
give orders, as if she were a captain herself!”
And she went on talking. But the others all
looked back and frowned “<em>Sh!</em>”</p>

<p>“We are coming near the nest, I reckon!”
explained Beverly in a whisper. “Nelly says
she hears something. We don’t want to
frighten the eagles away if they are there.”
At this Anne was sulkily silent. There seemed
nothing to reply.</p>

<p>They tiptoed through the woods, trying not
to snap the underbrush. Climbing over a
fallen old log, Gilda was unlucky enough to
lose her balance and fall head foremost with
a crash. “<em>Sh!</em>” warned the whole Club in a
gigantic whisper. And it sounded so funny
as a chorus that they all began to shake with
laughter they must not express aloud. Gilda
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
picked herself up unhurt, and they crept on.
Finally Nelly halted the procession and they
gathered about her to hear what she had to
say.</p>

<p>“The nest is up in the top of that great
tall pine tree there on the edge of the swamp,”
she whispered. “Uncle says it has been there
perhaps a hundred years. And that maybe
the same pair of eagles have been here ever
since he was a boy. Eagles never desert their
mates, and they are the most devoted mothers
and fathers. Listen! Do you hear that high
little pipe? That’s an eagle now.”</p>

<p>It did not seem possible that the shrill,
harsh sound could be the voice of the king of
birds!</p>

<p>“There is the nest,” whispered Nelly, pointing.
“See! There is something up there!”
A great platform of coarse twigs projected
from a crotch near the top of the huge pine
tree. Below the trunk was bare. While they
peered in turn through the bird-glasses that
Norma had brought, they could make out two
huge bird-shaped objects silhouetted against
the sky, perched on top of this rude nest. They
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
were the children of the bald-headed eagle.
The squawking little monsters were begging
for food with greedy bills, as undignified as
young robins.</p>

<p>“Where do you suppose the old birds are?”
asked Norma.</p>

<p>“Gone to get dinner for the family, probably,”
answered Nelly. “They may be fishing
for themselves down by the sea, or stealing
from the fish-hawks, like robbers. I daresay
they are miles away. Their great wings are so
strong.”</p>

<p>“I wish I could see those babies better,”
said Nancy discontentedly. “It’s hard to tell
where the birds leave off and the nest begins.
I am going to climb up in this tall spruce and
see them nearer.” The spruce was about
twenty feet from the pine and half as tall.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t try it, Nancy!” begged Nelly
Sackett.</p>

<p>“No, I wouldn’t,” added Norma. “The old
birds might come. It’s too hard a climb for
a girl.”</p>

<p>That was enough. “Pooh!” said Nancy beginning
to mount. “I can climb as well as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
any boy!” And indeed she scaled the tree like
a young monkey.</p>

<p>“Tante told us to keep together,” protested
Nelly Sackett. “Please, Nancy!” But Nancy
retorted:</p>

<p>“She meant keep together <em>horizontally</em>.
This is <em>vertically</em>! That’s different!” She
was half way up the tree, pulling herself from
crotch to crotch, and grumbling at the spruce
gum with which the tree was too generously
supplied. “I’m all sticky, but I can see finely
now!” she cried. “There are two babies, and
their heads are rusty brown. Oh, they are
<em>plain</em>!”</p>

<p>They could see Nancy clinging far up in
the tree; and the little eagles seemed also to
spy her. For they set up a horrible squawking.
Presently the girls heard another sound.
A high piping scream far away, but growing
louder.</p>

<p>“The old eagles are coming!” cried Nelly
Sackett. “Hurry up, Nancy! Come down!”</p>

<p>You cannot hurry very fast coming down
from a high tree. Nancy began to descend.
But before she had gone very far a great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
shadow came between her and the sun.
Mighty wings with a stretch of at least seven
feet from tip to tip seemed to Nancy like the
pinions of the Roc in the Arabian Nights.
There were two of the birds, and they were
circling round her high up in the air, screaming
frightfully. The old eagles had come to
defend their babies!</p>

<p>Nancy suddenly remembered the stories
she had read about the fierceness of eagles
when their young are in danger. She knew
they would try to peck her eyes, or beat her
with their great wings.</p>

<p>“Keep in the thick part of the tree, Nancy!”
called out Nelly. “They can’t get at you
there.”</p>

<p>Nancy clung close to the trunk, and gradually
let herself slip down to the ground where
the other girls were cowering, very white and
anxious. The eagles could not get at them
there, though they still circled screaming
overhead. The trees grew too thickly; the
great birds would not venture down among
them where those enormous wings might be
entangled in the branches. Eagles have to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
fight in the open; which is the only hope of
the small, weak creatures they would otherwise
make their prey.</p>

<p>“Oh Nancy!” Cicely grabbed her cousin
with trembling hands. “I was so frightened!”</p>

<p>“It was a silly thing to do,” Nancy confessed
rather shamefacedly. “Mother will
certainly have the right to scold me. Since
I wouldn’t keep together, I was very nearly
taken apart! I’ll not forget our motto in a
hurry, girls!”</p>

<p>“Let’s get away from here,” suggested
Beverly. And the others were eager to do
as she said. Tripping and breathless they
made their way through the woods back to
the main path up the mountain. The old
eagles followed them for some distance, high
up above the trees, screaming their anger at
the meddling humans. But finally they gave
up the pursuit, deciding perhaps to go back
and hear what their youngsters had to tell
about it. The girls breathed more freely
when the sound of those most unregal voices
ceased screaming overhead. But they did not
pause for rest or for lunch, till they had the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
swamp and another small mountain between
them and the eagle’s nest; till, in fact, they
were on top of the highest mountain, where
they chose a nice shady spot out of the wind
and sank down to eat and enjoy the view.

<p>They were pretty tired, exhausted with excitement
and extremely hungry. They did
not talk much till it was time to start down the
mountain again.</p>

<h3>LOST</h3>


<p class="in_dropcap"><span class="flt_lt_std">“</span><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smcap">t</span> will be easy going down,” said Nelly
Sackett, when they were rested and
ready. “There are several trails down
from the top in different directions. But I
told Tante we would return the way we came,
because that is the quickest way to Round
Robin.”</p>

<p>They started off at a brisk pace. “If anyone
gets tired, sing out, and we will stop for
a rest,” Nelly shouted over her shoulder. “But
all keep together.”</p>

<p>“All right!” chorused the Club. But who
wants to be the first to cry “tired”? The foremost
girls started to skip and hop down the
path, and after that they found it hard to go
slowly, though their knees began to feel queer
kinks. Again Anne brought up the rear; this
time because she was really tired. The others
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
were so busy watching their own rollicking
steps, laughing and squealing, that no one noticed
how Anne was gradually falling further
and further behind.</p>

<p>“I don’t need to ask Nelly Sackett’s permission
to rest,” Anne said to herself sulkily. She
had started out of sorts, and had been growing
no less so as the day grew long. “The others
can go on a bit,” she thought. “I’m tired of
hearing their voices. I’ll catch up when I
get ready, for it’s easy walking on this path.”</p>

<p>Anne was not timid about being alone in
the woods, as Beverly was. She sat down
under a great pine tree and took off her hat,
to cool her hot forehead. It was quiet and
peaceful in the shade. Around a bend in the
path she saw Beverly’s knapsack disappear,
as she cantered after the other girls. Anne
breathed a sigh of relief. Somewhere in the
woods a hermit thrush began to sing his flute-like
song; always in three parts. Anne
listened eagerly. She had never heard one
so near before, though Norma had taught her
the song. She rested some time, till the thrush
stopped singing, then she felt quite ready to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
start on again. She picked herself up with
a triumphant feeling that she had done as she
pleased, with nobody’s leave.</p>

<p>“It’s easy enough to follow a blazed trial,”
mused Anne out loud. It seemed natural to
talk out loud in the woods, when one was
alone. “I don’t see why they make such a
fuss about being ‘careful.’ I remember these
trees perfectly. I remember everything!”</p>

<p>The blazes on the trees were fresh and plain
along here. But presently Anne came to a
place where a great pine had fallen under the
storms of the previous hard winter, and lay
right across the path. Another had crashed
into a grove of spruces and had taken them
all down with it to ruin. “I remember we
went out of the way around this,” said Anne.
She made a wide detour, and looking carefully,
came again upon blazes, quite conspicuous
ones. She had lost time in rediscovering
the path. “I see why it is better to keep together,
on a long walk,” she said to herself.
“A lot of eyes can spy blazes quicker. I’ll
have to hurry to catch up with the rest, unless
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
they stop. I think they will stop for me.”
She hurried on a little faster.</p>

<p>“I wonder if paths always look so different
coming down?” thought Anne a little later.
Again she came to a blind part of the trail.
A perfect maze of fallen trees had wiped out
every sign of a path. And a great moss-covered
boulder stood square in the way. “I
certainly never saw that rock before! We
should have spoken of it,” said Anne dubiously.
“I don’t see any blazes—&#8203;oh yes, there
is one. But it looks very old and faint, not
like those we followed this morning. There’s
another! Can I be on the right path? They
did not say there was another branching off.”</p>

<p>This was a very wriggling narrow path indeed,
and Anne could not help seeing that it
was different from the one she remembered.
She began to feel rather nervous, and she remembered
with a pang Tante’s last words to
the Club—&#8203;“Above all, <em>keep together. Together</em>
is a safe motto, especially in the
woods.” No one answered her repeated calls.</p>

<p>The path grew vaguer and vaguer. Sometimes
the blazes seemed quite obliterated.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
Sometimes there seemed groups of them
marking paths that led in opposite ways.
Anne had to choose as best she could what
seemed the right general direction.</p>

<p>Finally she came out quite abruptly into
a sort of clearing, where the blazes converged
in a hopeless muddle. Probably it was the
site of an old wood-cutters’ camp, and these
were the paths the men had made to get lumber,
leading nowhere but to the place where
some big tree had stood. Anne had no idea
which way to go next. She was indeed lost. She
shouted, but no one answered. Her voice did
not seem to carry far; only the twittering of
frightened birds and the mocking caw of an
old black crow answered her.</p>

<p>Anne sat down, breathless, to think; and
for the first time she was really frightened.
Once she fancied she heard a far-off shout,
that might be the Club yell. But it seemed
to come from the wrong direction; and not
hearing it again, in answer to hers, she concluded
she had been mistaken.</p>

<p>Suddenly she heard the sharp crack of a
rifle somewhere in the woods beyond her.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
There was no mistaking that sound. “Somebody
is hunting!” she thought. “Suppose he
should shoot me by mistake!” She jumped
to her feet and hurried forward again, away
from the sound of the shot.</p>

<p>Then she discovered all of a sudden that she
was on a broad, well-marked trail leading
down the mountain. This was encouraging,
for she could walk faster now. But she
stopped abruptly in a few moments. She had
spied something through the trees. It was a
hut in the woods beside the trail; a hut away
off in this lonely spot on the side of a mountain
that was supposed to be uninhabited!</p>

<p>It was a shiftless low shack of rough logs
covered with tar-paper. From a tiny chimney
a thin coil of smoke was rising. About the
hut was a disorderly litter of barrels and boxes
and earthen jugs. A wheelbarrow stood by
the door. Probably there was someone in
the house who could tell her which way to
go home. But Anne had no desire to investigate
the owner of this lonely, untidy place.
Her one thought was to get away as soon as
possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
Down the path she ran wildly, stumbling
and sometimes falling, as the roots of the
ground-pine and the rolling pebbles seemed
trying to trip her. The path made a continuous
curve. Soon Anne had lost all account
of direction, as well as of time. When she
had run some distance and was thoroughly out
of breath, she made up her mind that she must
stop to rest. Then she saw that she was coming
out of the thick woods. Suddenly, the
path made a jump out onto a beach, a tiny
crescent of pebbly sand, hidden from the open
sea by a rocky island close to shore, and by
other reefs beyond. Anne stepped on to the
pebbles and looked about quite dazed. There
was nothing to tell where she was or in which
direction was home. There was nothing
familiar on land or sea.</p>

<p>Presently Anne spied a small motor-boat
anchored in the tiny harbor. And at the same
moment she became aware that she was not
alone in the cove. A man was stooping over
some boxes which he had evidently just
brought ashore. They lay at the entrance of
what looked like a cave in the cliff. The man
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
glanced up over his shoulder at the sound of
Anne’s feet on the pebbles. Then he sprang
erect with a jerk, like a jumping-jack.</p>

<p>“Hello!” he cried in gruff surprise that was
not pleasure. “Where’d <em>you</em> come from?”</p>

<p>He was a tall rough-looking man in fisherman’s
clothes and boots and a tarpaulin hat.
Around his throat was a knotted red handkerchief,
and he looked rather like a pirate.
What with the cave and the piles of boxes and
barrels at the entrance, Anne thought of
Dick’s favorite story of pirate treasure; and
for a moment she imagined she was dreaming.
But the man recalled her, repeating his question
impatiently and taking a step towards her.</p>

<p>“I say, who are you and where’d you come
from?” When the man frowned he had a
still more dangerous look.</p>

<p>Anne’s heart sank. Beverly would probably
have fainted away. “I’m lost, I guess,”
she said faintly. “We went up on the mountain
from our camp near the Harbor, and I
got separated from the others. Will you
please tell me how to get home?”</p>

<p>“Home?” echoed the man, eyeing her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
sharply. “Why, the Harbor’s miles from
here!”</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Anne in despair. “What
shall I do?”</p>

<p>“You never kin walk it,” said the man
gruffly. “I don’t see how you got here. Down
the mount-ing, eh? H’m! Some journey!”</p>

<p>“Yes!” assented Anne. “Miles!”</p>

<p>The man had a sudden idea. “Did ye see
anything in the woods as ye come along?”
Anne shook her head. “I heard a shot,” she
said, “that was what frightened me, so I ran.
Perhaps it was you?” she had spied a rifle
lying on the beach beside the stranger.</p>

<p>“Mebbe,” said the man shortly. “Shootin’
fish. No luck, though. Didn’t see anything
else in the woods, did ye?”</p>

<p>“I saw a house that looked as if somebody
was in it,” said Anne truthfully. “Smoke was
coming out of the chimney.”</p>

<p>“Fergit it!” said the man sharply. “Smoke?
You was dreamin’. Or else it’s ha’nted. Yes,
that’s it; that house is ha’nted! Old hermit
lived there once. Nobody remembers it; but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
it’s so. I wouldn’t speak of it to nobody,
if I was you. Bad luck!”</p>

<p>Anne thought he talked strangely, and
wondered if she had a crazy man to deal with.
But his next words reassured her. “I s’pose
I could take ye a piece of the way home
in my boat,” he said rather dubiously. “Ye
got to get away somehow.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you!” cried Anne gratefully.
“They will be so worried about me at Camp.”
He rowed her out to the boat in a light dory
that served as his tender. “Jump in,” he said
roughly, taking her by the arm to steady her.</p>

<p>“Where shall I sit?” she asked, looking
around the boat, for there was no seat of any
kind. Evidently this was no passenger-boat.
“Set right down in the bottom,” commanded
the man. And though it neither looked nor
smelled clean, Anne obeyed the look in the
man’s eye. From where she crouched she could
see nothing but blue sky. The stranger steered
standing. His back was towards her and his
hat hid his face completely. He spoke no
word as the boat chugged along into what
seemed to Anne the middle of the ocean, so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
entirely was all sight of land hidden from
her. Once she started to climb to her feet,
to see where they were going.</p>

<p>“Set down!” roared the man, who seemed
to have eyes in the back of his head. And
after that Anne kept still. It seemed to her
that the boat threaded a very winding course;
but she could not really tell. Indeed, all
water-courses had to be more or less crooked
in this part of the world, on account of the
many reefs and islands.</p>

<p>They went for a long time, perhaps fifteen
minutes, before the man spoke to Anne.
“Ye’ve made me a lot of trouble,” he said
crossly. “Don’t do it again!”</p>

<p>“Indeed I won’t,” said Anne fervently.
“I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>“Ye’d better keep yer mouth shut about
what ye’ve seen to-day,” he shot out the words
with a growl, “or ye’ll be sorry! I’m goin’
to set you ashore pretty soon, not far from yer
Camp. Ye’ll have about half a mile to walk;
but that ain’t bad for a stocky miss like you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Anne meekly.</p>

<p>The shadows were slanting low in the west
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
when the pilot made a sharp turn and the
boat entered the still waters of a cove. The
engine stopped and they drifted. “Ye may
git yer feet a bit wet,” said the man; “but
I hope ye’re no molly-coddle, if ye’re a
camper. Here, git up!” Anne climbed to
her feet, rather numb and stiff, and looked
around. The place seemed strange, yet curiously
familiar. She could not tell what was
the matter.</p>

<p>“Which way do I go?” she asked bewildered,
when she was ashore.</p>

<p>The man laughed but seemed pleased at
her question. “<em>That</em> way,” he said, pointing.
“Pike along now, <em>and fergit it</em>!” He repeated
the last words again with emphasis, shaking
his head solemnly with a threat in his voice.</p>

<p>Anne looked about her dazedly. “Why, I
should have guessed it was <em>that</em> way!” she
murmured. “I’m all turned around!”</p>

<p>“Must have gone right round the mount-ing,”
said the man with a grin. “And it’s
pathless wilderness, too,” he spoke slowly.
“Ye’re lucky to git off so well, I tell ye!”
He was rowing away in the boat. “What’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
yer name, missy?” he asked with a sudden
thought, lying on his oars. “I might want to
remember it, in case ye don’t do as I say.
In case ye <em>tell</em>!”</p>

<p>Anne had a mind not to reply, and to run
for home instead. But she was too doubtful
about the path, and she spoke her name.</p>

<p>“Anne Poole!” exclaimed the man. “Not
Chester Poole’s gal?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes,” said Anne, surprised at his
black look.</p>

<p>The man in the boat gave an exclamation.
He seemed half inclined to put back after
her. “The scalawag!” he muttered. “If I’d
’a known that!” But Anne waited to hear no
more, not even to thank him for the kindness
he seemed already to repent. She began to
run along the path, strangely confused because
it seemed to go in the wrong direction.
It was like running “through the looking
glass!” It was only when she caught sight
of the boys’ camp, and Dick Reed coming
to meet her with a shout of welcome, that she
was sure she was really headed for home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
“<em>Scalawag!</em>” the word echoed in her ears.
She had never heard it before. What did the
man mean? Was he insulting her or her
father with that name? She resolved to hold
her tongue as he bade her.

<h3>ANOTHER SIDE</h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">In</span> answer to Dick’s reassuring call “Here
she is!” the Round Robin came running,
pale and anxious, to greet Anne. Not a
word of reproach did she hear. Only affectionate
joy that she was safe.</p>

<p>The girls had re-climbed the mountain as
soon as they missed Anne, and had hunted
for her up and down, until they saw it was
growing late, when they were afraid of being
overtaken by the dark. When they returned
with the news that Anne was lost, the Camp
was in consternation. Dick wanted to start
out immediately on search. But Tante made
the boy wait to hear what Captain Sackett
should advise, after Nelly had told him.</p>

<p>While Anne had her late supper the others
gathered round to hear her story. The Twins
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
could not get close enough to her. But mindful
of the tall stranger’s caution, Anne did not
mention the hut in the woods, nor say much
about the man who had brought her home;
though she did mention the cave, at which
word Dick pricked up his ears.</p>

<p>Even while Anne was concluding her
description of how it felt to be lost alone on
the mountain; and while the Twins were still
shivering to think how dreadful it would
have been to stay out there all night, Captain
Sackett came striding up. His wrinkled face
was anxious and drawn. He carried a lantern
in his hand, evidently prepared to make search
through the dark for the lost girl.</p>

<p>“Any news?” he called from a distance,
unable to wait. And when they shouted
“Found!” he gave a low fervent ejaculation
of thanksgiving that went straight to Anne’s
heart. “I didn’t know anybody cared so much
about me!” she said to herself.</p>

<p>“Nelly’s almost sick,” said the Captain.
“She blames herself for having let Anne get
lost. For of course, this one’s a tender-foot,
though she has lived in these parts longer than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
Nelly has. The girl oughtn’t to have let Anne
stray off. I told her so!” The Cap’n looked
unwontedly stern for him.</p>

<p>“Oh, it wasn’t Nelly’s fault,” Anne hastened
to say. “It was my own doing. I didn’t follow
my leader, but stopped without telling. And
that was breaking the Club rule. It was silly
of me! I’m sorry.” Anne drooped, very tired
and ashamed.</p>

<p>The Captain looked at her kindly. “That’s
right,” he said with approval. “Not ashamed
to say you’re sorry when it’s your own fault.
Well, I’m glad it turned out all right! That
saves me a hunt to-night. I’ll hurry back and
tell Nelly, so she and Polly won’t be worryin’.
And I’ll tell Maguire and Chatto they
won’t have to comb the mountain with me
after all. You would have had the whole
neighborhood busy huntin’ for you, girl!” he
said to Anne, grinning affectionately.</p>

<p>“Oh, I shouldn’t think they’d do it for <em>me</em>!”
said Anne humbly, remembering how little
notice she had ever taken of the people at the
Harbor. She didn’t even know the men who
belonged to those names.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
“Neighbors are neighbors,” said the old
man. “Everybody turns to and helps in time
of trouble, don’t they? That’s American!”</p>

<p>“Tell Nelly she is a splendid leader,” said
Anne shyly, “and I’ll never hang back again
on a trail. And please tell her I am coming
over to-morrow to see her—&#8203;and the rabbit.”</p>

<p>Everybody was glad enough to go to bed,
tired and frightened as they all had been in
various ways. But they did not all go immediately
to sleep. After Anne and Beverly
were safely tucked into their little cots, the
southern girl whispered another story to her
tent-mate’s astonished and horrified ears; a
tale with which she had decided not to burden
the already over-worried Tante until to-morrow.</p>

<p>“Who do you fancy your old man was,
Anne?” she drawled. “Because I daresay he
was the same man who was hunting the deer,
and who so nearly shot me. But how could
he be in two places at the same time, on the
sea-shore and in the woods? Unless he has
the Seven League Boots that Nancy is always
talking about.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
“Nearly shot you, Beverly? What do you
mean?” Anne who was almost ready for sleep,
came wide awake again and sat up in bed
with a gasp of horror.</p>

<p>“Why, didn’t anybody tell you-all? It was
like this. We were poking down the mountain
the second time, pretty tired and discouraged
because we couldn’t find you, Anne.
It seemed awful to leave you there alone on
the mountain, and night coming on. It makes
me creep to think of it now! Those dark
woods! But what could we do?”</p>

<p>“I was a goose,” said Anne. “How tired
you must all be!”</p>

<p>“Well, Nancy was a little ahead,” Beverly
went on. “She didn’t seem so tired as the
rest of us, and Nelly was close behind her.
Nelly had just said ‘We must keep together,
girls, for it is growing darker.’ When Norma
cried ‘Hark! I hear something!’ You know
how sharp her ears are, being a musician?
‘It must be Anne coming!’ I said, and I was
pleased. So I ran out to meet you. Something
brown was coming, sure enough, just
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
the color of our khaki suits. It came leaping
and crackling the bushes, as if frightened.
And then I saw it was a beautiful tawny deer
followed by two baby fawns, like long-legged
yellow dogs. They were coming straight towards
me, the pretty things! But when they
spied us they swerved abruptly and bounded
away into the underbrush and were out of
sight in a minute. We were so surprised that
we didn’t move or speak a word. Then all of
a sudden Nelly Sackett who was close to me
gave a jump right at me and knocked me down
on the ground.”</p>

<p>“Why, what did she do that for?” cried
Anne.</p>

<p>“Lucky she did!” answered Beverly. “It
was the quickest thing you ever saw, and it
saved my life. ‘Don’t fire!’ yelled Nelly as
she jumped. But in that very same instant
there was a rifle-crack. The bullet must have
gone right over my head. It hit the tree behind
me!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Beverly! Who fired it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know who he was. But a minute
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
later a man’s head poked out of the bushes.
He had the most wicked, dark face, but he
looked frightened enough then. ‘I thought it
was a deer,’ he said in a gruff voice with a
curious accent. ‘Didn’t mean nothin’.’ And
without another word he disappeared.”</p>

<p>“That must have been the shot I heard!”
said Anne. “O Beverly, if I had known what
it was! How brave Nelly was to save you!”</p>

<p>“That makes another hero in that family,”
said Beverly. “They just seem to do the right
thing when the time comes, don’t they?”</p>

<p>“Beverly, what did that man look like?”
asked Anne thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“He was short and dingy, with a black
beard and little bright eyes,” she answered.
“He wore a cap and a red shirt. I couldn’t
see any more in that quick minute. But I
reckon he was some kind of strange foreigner.”
Beverly’s voice was growing drowsy, and she
drawled more than ever.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t my man!” thought Anne. “I
wonder which of them lives in the ‘ha’nted
house’? And what is he doing there all by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
himself? I wonder what that man meant by
‘Scalawag’? And oh, how glad I am Beverly
was not killed!”</p>

<p>With a grateful heart at the end of an eventful
day, Anne fell asleep.</p>

<h3>COSTUMES</h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Tante</span> was going to have a birthday.
It was the Twins who let out the secret
which they had been charged to keep.
But it is easy to understand how, while it is
hard enough for <em>one</em> person to keep a secret,
it must be twice as hard when you are <em>two</em>!</p>

<p>“What shall we do to celebrate Tante’s
birthday?” asked Beverly, consulting the
Club. In view of her relation to the person
in question, Nancy declined to act as chairman.
There were six in conclave, Nelly
Sackett being absent, for this was a hurry-up
call. The birthday was only two days distant,
the family secret having been well kept till
now.</p>

<p>“We must have something jolly, where
everybody can do something,” suggested
Cicely. Someone spoke of a play; but they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
agreed that would take too long to prepare.
Somebody else thought a surprise party would
be nice. But then everyone would not be
taking part. Tante must be in it too.</p>

<p>“Let’s have a dress-up party! I know what
I want to be!” It was of course Norma’s idea.
Norma was always acting out some part or
“trying something on to prettify herself,” as
Dick said.</p>

<p>The suggestion appealed to the Club at
once. “Let’s ask Tante if she would like it,”
said Beverly. And Tante said she should like
it very much indeed. She too had always enjoyed
dressing up. There would be a full
moon, and they could parade and dance or do
whatever they liked out of doors under the
trees in the early evening.</p>

<p>At first Hugh and Victor demurred. The
idea of dressing-up seemed silly to them.
“We’ll look on,” they said, man-like.</p>

<p>“Oh no! Everybody must be in costume!”
declared Tante. “Nobody can be a mere
spectator at my party. I am sure you can
find something to wear without much trouble;
just to please me!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
“All right!” said Victor with a sudden grin.
“I have an idea.” Then Hugh said he had
an idea too—&#8203;a <em>dark secret</em>! As for Reddy, he
could hardly wait, he was so eager to get into
his costume.</p>

<p>“What about Nelly Sackett?” asked Beverly.
“We must let her know in time to get ready.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” agreed Nancy. “She will have
to hurry, if she has only to-morrow to fix her
costume, by herself. She said she was not
coming over to-day. Can’t someone take time
to let her know?”</p>

<p>“I’ll go over and tell her,” said Anne unexpectedly.
“I was going any way to see my
rabbit, Plon.”</p>

<p>“You can ask Nelly to stay all night,” suggested
Mrs. Batchelder. “We can put her
up somewhere. We have done it before.”</p>

<p>“She can have my bed,” said Beverly
eagerly. “I will sleep on the floor.”</p>

<p>“No, I will,” said Anne, after a minute.</p>

<p>“Well, you can settle that later,” suggested
Tante. “You can even pull your two cots
together and make them up crosswise for
three. Once when I was a little girl I went
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
visiting with some of my cousins, and seven
of us girls slept in one bed! To be sure that
was in the days of the big old-fashioned bedsteads,
which were like arks.”</p>

<p>“I’ll paddle you around in the canoe, Anne,
if you like,” offered Dick. “I’ve agreed to
go to the Harbor for the mail. And I’ll call
for you on the way back.”</p>

<p>“That would be very nice,” said Anne gratefully.</p>

<p>“Dick is going to buy a costume at the Harbor;
no fair!” cried Norma.</p>

<p>“Let’s make it a rule that nobody shall buy
anything new. Let’s put together our costumes
entirely out of whatever we already have,”
said Tante, who knew how very little pocket
money most of the campers had.</p>

<p>“Or whatever we can find, or make out of
nothing?” added Nancy.</p>

<p>“Or borrow?” suggested Anne. “We can
borrow or lend, can’t we?”</p>

<p>“Of course!” they chorused. Already they
had an eye on one another’s possessions. “But
don’t anyone tell what you are going to be,”
cautioned Nancy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>So it was agreed.</p>

<p>The girls scattered in various directions.
Anne went straight to the store-room and
rummaged in the trunks which she had not
opened since she came to Round Robin. “I
thought I might have a chance to wear this,”
she said exultingly to herself, as she drew out
a shimmering mass from its tissue-paper folds.
“Mother said it was nonsense to bring a Columbine
dress down here. But now I am glad
I did. Nobody will have anything half so
fine. Now let’s see if I can’t find something
for Nelly. It would be nice to help her out.
I expect she hasn’t anything that would do
to wear.”</p>

<p>Anne went on rummaging. “Why, here’s
that nun’s costume!” she said presently. “I
didn’t know Mother put that in, it’s so ugly.
I wonder if Nelly would care about that? She
could wear anything underneath and be comfortable.
I think I will take it over to her.”</p>

<p>Anne folded up the nun’s costume and
tucked it under her arm. Dick was waiting
in the canoe. “Hello!” he called as she came
down the path. “What you got there? A
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
costume for Nelly, I bet! Going to dress her
up as a guardian angel or something?” Anne
stopped short and hesitated.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” she said, turning in the
path. “I’ve got to go back for something,
Reddy.” When she came down the path
again she had quite a different bundle under
her arm; a package in white tissue paper.</p>

<p>“That looks still more like an angel’s robe
than the other did,” grinned Dick. But Anne
did not tell him what it was.</p>

<p>As soon as they were off in the canoe Dick
began to ask Anne more questions about her
adventure on the mountain, which had made
a great impression on his imagination. He
had already bothered her so much that she
grew impatient whenever he returned to the
subject. Which direction was the cave? What
did the place look like when she came down
the mountain? Had she noticed which way
the sun was? Weren’t there any landmarks?
Did the man look like a pirate? If pirates
were in the wind Dick wanted to be the one
to find them. Anne was vague, but she stuck
to one point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
“It was a long way from here; it took at
least half an hour to come. And we came
from the <em>south</em>—&#8203;no, not from the north,
Reddy!”</p>

<p>“You must have walked miles off the trail
to get down to the south of the mountain,”
Dick persisted. “I can’t understand it!” But
Anne reminded him that he had met her returning
from the south of the camp, which he
couldn’t deny.</p>

<p>“I don’t see through it!” muttered Dick,
completely mystified. He had scoured every
foot of shore from Round Robin to the Harbor,
and for miles beyond. But no cave could
he find. When he asked discreet questions
of the natives like Lonny Maguire, the ablest
fisherman of them all, or of Hopkins the lighthouse
keeper, who had always lived here, they
shook their heads and said they didn’t know
of any cave on the main-land at the foot of the
mountain.</p>

<p>“They would be likely to know if there was
such a cave, now wouldn’t they?” argued
Dick. He began to believe that Anne had
been dreaming.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
But Anne only said positively, “I know
what I saw, Reddy. Let’s not talk any more
about it.”</p>

<p>“Right-o!” said Reddy. But he did not
mean to quit looking just yet.</p>

<p>By this time they had reached the Captain’s
cove, and Dick set Anne ashore, promising
to call for her again in about an hour.</p>

<p>Anne started up the path with her white
package under her arm, and met Nelly coming
down.</p>

<p>“Hello!” said Nelly in surprise, for Anne
had been over only the day before to visit
the rabbit. “All alone?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Anne. “Dick brought me. I
wanted to see you by yourself. It’s a secret.
You see, the Club is going to have a dress-up
party for Tante’s birthday, day after to-morrow.
And of course you are to come.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” agreed Nelly, simply.</p>

<p>“And you will have to wear a fancy costume.
Everybody will.”</p>

<p>“But I never can get ready so soon. I
haven’t any dress,” protested Nelly.</p>

<p>“That’s what I thought,” said Anne eagerly,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
with the tactlessness she had yet to unlearn.
It made Nelly flush. But Anne went on with
the best will in the world. “So I came to
bring you something that I think will do
nicely, and will look lovely on you. I hope
you will wear it. It will save a lot of trouble.”
She held out the package to Nelly.</p>

<p>Nelly looked eager but doubtful. “Come
up to the house and let Mother look, too,” she
said, and the two girls scampered up the path.</p>

<p>“Mother! Anne has brought me a dress,”
said Nelly Sackett, explaining to Aunt Polly
in a few words. “Come right up to my room,”
she invited Anne, leading the way up the narrow
stairway to the second story.</p>

<p>Nelly’s room was small. Anne thought she
had never been in so small a bedroom; unless
you dignify a tent with that name. But
Nelly’s room was clean as a whistle, with
quaint old-fashioned furniture and braided
rugs, and an ancient hand-woven bedquilt
that Mrs. Poole would have coveted. Out
of the east window Nelly had the prettiest
view of the sea; while from the other corner
she looked right into the branches of an old
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
apple tree, gnarled and twisted by its hard life
in the bleak Cove, during northern winters.</p>

<p>“You can lay it on my bed,” said Nelly,
smoothing the blue and white quilt. Aunt
Polly had followed more slowly up the steep
flight, and now stood watching, hands on hips,
while Anne unfolded the sheets of tissue and
shook out the ruffles of white tarlatan. Anne
handled the pretty Columbine dress as if she
loved it.</p>

<p>“Oh, how lovely!” cried Nelly, gently
touching the spangled sparkling bodice, the
satin slippers and the tinsel wand. Anne held
up the crown of flowers and looked at it with
her head on one side.</p>

<p>“It is pretty, isn’t it?” she said. “I danced
in it at a fancy-dress party last winter. But
that was indoors. It will look even lovelier
out of doors, in the moon-light, under the
trees! This crown will be nice on your curly
hair.”</p>

<p>“I never saw anything so sweet!” exclaimed
Nelly. “But it might get hurt.”</p>

<p>“You and I are about the same size,” Anne
went on, not noticing the objection. “I’m sure
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
you can wear the slippers and everything.
Won’t you try them on?”</p>

<p>“But what are you going to wear?” asked
Nelly. “Yes,” added Aunt Polly, “what about
you, Anne?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I have something,” said Anne carelessly.
“There’s another dress I wore in a
play, at school—&#8203;a nun’s dress; that will do
very nicely.” She could not help thinking
how ugly the nun’s costume really was. Nelly
had been thinking too.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it is half as pretty as this,”
she said. “I can’t wear your things, when
you ought to wear them yourself. Besides,
I never had on a dress like this in my life,
and I’d feel funny wearing it out of doors.”</p>

<p>“She would so,” agreed Aunt Polly wagging
her head. “But it was kind of you to
think of it, Anne.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t kind,” protested Anne. “Please take
the dress, Nelly. I’d like to give it to you.
I have lots of dresses at home.”</p>

<p>Nelly hesitated, fingering the tarlatan folds.
“No,” she said slowly, “I’d rather not, thank
you. It wouldn’t be nice. I’ll fix something
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
else. I guess I can think of something easy.”</p>

<p>“But what? What can you be?” Anne was
really disappointed, and showed it like a
spoiled child who isn’t having her own way.</p>

<p>“I’ll be—&#8203;I’ll be—&#8203;a mermaid!” said Nelly
suddenly. “That’s easy! Nancy said once that
I’d make a fine mermaid, with my hair loose,
and my green bathing-suit, and some shells.”</p>

<p>“Then I shall be a mermaid, too!” declared
Anne. “My bathing suit is red; but we can
get kelp and things and drape both. My hair
isn’t pretty and long like yours, but I can
make some with seaweed. Mermaids can’t
dance, but we will <em>swim</em>. Let’s go as mermaids
together. Shall we, Nelly?” Aunt
Polly looked as pleased as Punch.</p>

<p>“All right, let’s!” Nelly agreed with shy
enthusiasm. “That will be fun! But who
will wear this lovely dress?” she touched it
again with a soft finger.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know—&#8203;Gilda, perhaps,” said
Anne carelessly. She did not know that Gilda
was already provided for. “Let’s go down
to the beach and get some shells and things
now before Dick comes back for me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
The two girls ran off, chatting and laughing.
And Aunt Polly standing in the doorway
watched them with kind eyes. In a moment
Anne darted back with a question.
“Aunt Polly,” she said, “if I come over some
morning very soon, will you show me how to
make biscuits like those you gave me yesterday?
I have got to take my turn at getting
supper before long. And I’d like to surprise
the Round Robin. They don’t think I can
do anything—&#8203;and I can’t!” she confessed.
“But I think I can learn, if Norma and
Beverly can.”</p>

<p>“Sure you can!” said Aunt Polly. “An
American girl ought to be able to do ’most
anything. Come right over Friday morning
and I’ll give you a lesson while I’m baking.”
Anne thanked her and ran off to join Nelly.</p>

<p>“Who’s that down on the beach with
Nelly?” asked Cap’n Sackett coming up to
the house from the opposite direction. Aunt
Polly told him of Anne’s errand. “Sho!” said
the Captain. “She’s got a good heart, that little
girl, hasn’t she, Polly? Mermaids is it,
they’re going to be? Lemme see; I guess I’ve
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
got some truck they might like.” And after
rummaging in the drawers of an old bureau
Cap’n Sackett joined the girls on the beach
with his arms full of an odd collection.</p>

<p>“Mermaids ahoy!” he shouted. “Here’s
some loot for ye. Want some coral beads?
I got ’em in the South Sea when I was a lad.
And here’s some strings of shells. Kinder
pretty, ain’t they? Want these things to dress
up with, eh?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes! How pretty they are!”</p>

<p>“We can make nets for our hair,” said
Nelly. “And look. Uncle, here are some
lovely long devil’s aprons we have found to
make us fringy tails.”</p>

<p>“You will give us some pieces of net to
drape over our shoulders, won’t you, Cap’n?”
begged Anne. “We shall be so trimmed-up
and beautiful that the old bathing suits will
hardly show.”</p>

<p>“Oh Anne! What fun it will be!” said
Nelly. “I’m glad we are going to dress alike.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad too,” said Anne. “It’s lots more
fun to make your own costume for a party
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
than to wear one that is all ready for you,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Here comes Dick,” said the Captain.
“Don’t leave your bundle, Anne.” Anne
picked up the tissue package which she had
left lying on the beach and had almost forgotten.</p>

<p>“Don’t forget to come over early, and plan
to spend the night,” she said to Nelly. “We
will dress in the bath house. Good-bye,
Nelly!”</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Anne!” the girls waved and
smiled until the canoe was out of the Cove.</p>

<h3>TANTE’S BIRTHDAY PARTY</h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Tante’s</span> birthday was a beautiful,
bright blue day; what the towns-folk
called a “<em>real</em> Harbor day.” You will
notice as you go around the world, that the
<em>real</em> day of any place you visit is always the
best kind of day one ever sees there. Perhaps
the same thing is true of people.</p>

<p>There were two rules at the Camp about
birthdays. One was that there should never
be any “boughten” presents. The second rule
was that the hero or heroine of the occasion
should do exactly as he pleased all day, and
that everyone should fall into his or her plans.</p>

<p>There was a curious collection of gifts at
Tante’s place when she came down to breakfast.
By her plate was a bowl of luscious
strawberries—&#8203;the last of the season, which the
Twins had found by very careful hunting over
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
acres of meadow the day before. They knew
how much their mother loved the wild strawberries,
and how lonesome she was going to
be without them for a whole year. “Well,
this will make the year a little shorter, won’t
it, Mummy?” said Freddie. “Only from
July till June.”</p>

<p>“Some day we are going to take Mummy
all up and down the world, wherever the
strawberries grow,” said Eddie. “Hugh says
we could begin in the winter in the far south
and chase them right up to the Arctic circle,
where they might still be juicy in September!
Wouldn’t that be fine?”</p>

<p>“But they would never be so good anywhere
as these are, I’m sure,” said Tante.</p>

<p>Norma had picked a beautiful bunch of
flowers for Tante—&#8203;little wild orchises and
ferns and cotton grass, which she had arranged
in an original jardinière made of a tin can
covered with birch bark. Cicely had strung
a beautiful necklace of hemlock cones with
the red beads of the bunchberry set between.
Beverly had finished at last the basket which
Sal Seguin had helped her begin. Indeed,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
Beverly had seen the old Indian woman twice
since that first visit. Once she had met her
by chance on the shore near the bathing beach,
and had brought down the half-finished basket
for advice. Once again old Sal had looked
her up in Camp, with a present of dyed red
grass. So Tante’s basket had a beautiful
border to finish it.</p>

<p>Nancy had written her mother a birthday
poem, and Hugh had whittled her a weather-vane—&#8203;a
round robin painted red, to go on the
flag pole in front of the Camp. Anne gave
her the prettiest pebble she had found—&#8203;lovely
mottled green with a white circle round it,
which made it a “lucky stone.” Victor had
painted her a little sketch.</p>

<p>As for Dick, that ingenious boy had made
a wind-harp by stringing the frame of a
wooden box with twisted silk thread. And
when Tante put it under the half-opened
window in a strong breeze, it made the most
odd and beautiful sounds, like fairy music
written in no human key.</p>

<p>“Nobody ever had such interesting presents!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
declared Tante, when she had looked
at them all.</p>

<p>“Mine you cannot see till ze evening,” said
Gilda with a sly nod. Tante knew quite well
that Gilda had been making candy all the
previous afternoon; and Gilda knew that she
knew. But it was a secret all the same.</p>

<p>“Now, what do you want to do, Mother?”
asked Hugh, following the second camp rule.
“We are your slaves to-day. Choose what you
would like best”</p>

<p>“I would like best to do exactly what I always
do!” laughed Tante. “A little work,
and a little play, a little reading, a little walk,
and a little rest. Nothing could be better than
that, for me. Every day is like a birthday, you
see, at Round Robin. Only we shall also have
a party this evening.”</p>

<p>Nelly Sackett came over early from the
Cove; and then Tante had two more presents.
For Nelly brought a great bowl of lobster
salad from Uncle Eph and Aunt Polly. And
she herself had made a wonderful rope of
twine, in twenty intricate knots and twists, for
Tante to use as a watch-chain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
After early supper Nelly retired with Anne
to the boat house on the beach, where they
could help one another to dress without being
disturbed, and, as Anne said, where they could
fish up more trimmings when they were
needed.</p>

<p>With much giggling they put on their bathing
suits and adjusted their seaweed skirts
which they had sewed firmly, each with a
long trailing tail. Anne had fashioned two
pretty loose caps of shells, which looked
quaint on their heads, one covering curly red
hair, the other perched on sea-weedy locks.
On their bare arms the mermaids wore strings
of coral beads and shells, and each carried in
her hand a great conch shell which Uncle
Eph had brought from some queer corner of
the world. They made a very alluring pair
of mermaids, just of a height, as they stole
up the path together when the signal horn
blew for the party to begin.</p>

<p>When they peeped through the bushes they
saw a strange company already gathered on
the grass in front of Round Robin. In the
middle of a little group about the flag-pole
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
stood a stately figure in red, white and blue.
On her head was a red liberty cap, and in
her hand she carried a horn of plenty. Behind
her stood an old and very black man,
with grinning white teeth and bushy hair. He
was dressed in shabby old clothes and wore
a broad-brimmed straw hat, and leaned on a
stick.</p>

<p>“Tante must be Columbia,” whispered
Nelly Sackett, “isn’t she lovely!” “But what
is Hugh?”</p>

<p>“I think he’s Uncle Remus,” guessed Anne.
“This is his ‘dark secret.’ Hugh is always
talking about ‘<cite>Brer Rabbit, he lay low!</cite>’ Let’s
wait a moment and see the others come.”</p>

<p>Two little Indians were frisking around the
feet of Columbia, chasing a clown dog in a
wonderful ruffled collar. It looked as if
Doughboy’s costume would not last through
the party, for it was already badly tattered.
The Twins with their bows and arrows wanted
to shoot everybody. But a Wild West character,
in a sombrero and leggings, with a red
handkerchief knotted about his neck and a
lasso in his hand, was trying to restrain them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
“Wow!” yelled Reddy as he dexterously
whirled his lasso over Indian Freddie’s
shoulders, bringing that youngster to the
ground, much to his astonishment. “Don’t
you be too rough with these strangers! It will
never do to scalp a Fairy!”</p>

<p>For out of the woods was gliding a beautiful
creature in green drapery fringed with
oak leaves, and with an oak garland on her
long golden hair. A green veil fell over her
shoulders and bare arms, which she waved
like wings. The clown dog fawned at her
feet in an adoring fashion.</p>

<p>“I am the Spirit of the Woods,” said a gentle
voice. No one but the English girl had a
voice like that. It did indeed sound like the
wind in the pine trees on a spring night. “The
Indians ought to love me, for I furnish them
with bark for their canoes and wood for their
bows and tepee poles. And I sing the little
papooses to sleep.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t Cicely sweet?” said Nelly admiringly,
and Anne agreed. She began to regret
the Columbine costume she had given up, and
glanced down at her make-shift rig with some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
misgiving. “If I had worn the other I should
easily be the finest,” she thought. But Nelly
Sackett had no such regret. “We will creep
up, like the tide, last of all,” she whispered,
squeezing Anne’s cold fingers.</p>

<p>Now from opposite directions two figures
emerged out of the woods. One was dressed
in a simple brown dress, with a white apron,
kerchief and cap, and carried a book in her
hand, trying to look demure. The other was
a pretty Italian peasant, with the brightest
colors in her head-dress and embroidered
apron. Long scarlet ear-rings—&#8203;made of partridge
berries—&#8203;dangled on her shoulders.
Norma had no difficulty in looking her part.</p>

<p>“Well met!” said the little brown maid
gravely. Nancy and Norma were the best
actors of the party, and had prepared their
speeches beforehand. “Thus you, the newest
emigrant, meet the earliest, on Columbia’s
ground.” Nancy dropped a curtsey to Norma.
“I represent my ancestor Ruth who came over
in the <i>Mayflower</i>.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">

 <br>
 <img src="images/i207.jpg"
 alt="a fairy creature">
 <p class="caption">a fairy creature—a gnome—a gypsy queen</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->
<br>

<p>“You are the New England Conscience;
but I am the Artistic Temperament,” smiled
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
Norma. “You weren’t very cordial to me at
first. But you are improving.”</p>

<p>“Even so, I might teach you something still,
of patience and courage and thrift. But I
am trying to get rid of my prejudices, anyway.
I do most awfully want to get what is best
for my Country. I have always tried to do
that, have I not, Columbia?”</p>

<p>“Yes; but you are apt to set too much store
by book-knowledge; and you’re apt to think
that anyone who did not come in the <i>Mayflower</i>
like yourself is the ‘scum of the earth!’”
retorted Norma.</p>

<p>“The Pilgrims made things ready for the
later emigrants,” said Nancy. “But you do
more complaining than we did.”</p>

<p>“Come now!” said Columbia, “I must have
no quarreling under my Flag. The Stars and
Stripes give peace and shelter to all kinds of
children. Miss Pilgrim, you must welcome
all the later pilgrims who come, as you did,
with a good heart and a high purpose. Some
of them need your gifts. But some of them
bring gifts that you needed.”</p>

<p>“That is so,” said Nancy magnanimously.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
“I’ll try to remember. But who are these
noisy creatures? I think you are entertaining
a good many disorderly persons, Mother Columbia.
You must look out!”</p>

<p>“They will have to obey my rules or they
cannot stay at my party!” said Columbia.
“But gaiety is not always disorder. It is sulkiness
that is unsafest.”</p>

<p>“‘<cite>Gone with the raggle-taggle gypsies O!</cite>’”
Voices singing, the click of bones and the
twang of strings announced the arrival of two
dancing, beribboned ones. Everybody but
Doughboy applauded the two gypsies who
now capered into the circle. Doughboy
strongly disapproved of the Romany. Victor
Lanfranc and Beverly had conspired very
successfully. The tall Victor had managed
to turn his old khaki uniform into gay apparel
with the aid of ribbons and patches. Over
his shoulder he wore Nancy’s red cape. He
had borrowed Norma’s plaid sash and he had
tied up his legs with crossed scarlet braid, instead
of puttees. He looked very picturesque
with his black mustache and a broad hat
slouched over a red bathing cap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
Beverly had the corn-popper slung over her
shoulder to represent a guitar, rubber bands
stretched across it, twanging under her
fingers. In a red table-cloth skirt, with a
bath-towel apron and a scarlet sweater, and
crowned with a waste-basket hat wreathed in
daisies, she was a dashing Gipsy queen.
There was a lull after their dance. “Let’s
go now,” whispered Anne. “They are about
all there now, I think.”</p>

<p>Making a swimming motion with their
arms the two mermaids glided into the moonlight,
and were greeted with various cries
from the group. “Hurrah!” “Look at the
Mermaids!” “<em>Bravissima!</em>” “<em>Bow wow!</em>”</p>

<p>Anne and Nelly swam around the group
with their long tails trailing in a very effective
fashion, to Doughboy’s great delight. Finally
they dived down into the grass and lay shaking
with laughter. For Doughboy had taken
this as a special invitation to play. And their
unrehearsed dive was the only way to stop his
attachment to them.</p>

<p>“Welcome, Sea Ladies!” Columbia hailed
them. “Old Ocean and his powers are the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
best friends of Columbia. She could not do
without you.”</p>

<p>“They are dressed alike, only one is red and
one is green,” said Freddie. “Are they lobsters,
Mother?”</p>

<p>“They look just alike; only one is curly and
one is weedy,” said Eddie. “That is so!” one
and another of the group agreed in surprise.
“I didn’t notice it before. Or is it just the
moonlight?”</p>

<p>“They might be sisters,” said Nancy wonderingly.
“Nelly and Anne!”</p>

<p>“Do we look alike?” whispered Nelly
Sackett rather wistfully to Anne.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Anne, trying not to
look annoyed. “Costumes do change people
a lot.” They sat down in the grass side by
side, with their tails gracefully curled under
them out of Doughboy’s reach.</p>

<p>“Everybody present?” asked Columbia.
“No, ma’am,” said Uncle Remus. “One chile
missing. Hello! Here it comes!”</p>

<p>A funny little noise like a bumble bee was
heard, one could not say from which direction.
It grew louder and louder, and presently
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
into the circle hopped the strangest little
round figure, with brown legs, brown body,
brown arms. It seemed a weird old gnome
with a long grey beard, a hooked red nose and
a pointed cap. He was blowing on some instrument
that might be a pipe.</p>

<p>“It’s a Brownie!” shouted Freddie. Eddie
cowered closer to his mother’s skirts. “Is he
real?” he asked. “Where did he come from?”</p>

<p>Indeed the Brownie was so real that no one
would have recognized him. He went dancing
around the circle, teasing the nearly
frantic Doughboy, then disappeared into the
woods. “Oh he’s gone! I wanted to see him
some more!” cried Freddie. On the word
the Brownie reappeared, dancing right up to
Freddie and tossing a cone into his lap. Another
cone hit Eddie on the nose. “It’s
Gilda!” he cried. “I know Gilda now!” and
off the two little Indians raced in a wild pursuit
of the Brownie. Presently they brought
him back a laughing prisoner.</p>

<p>“We’ll burn him at the stake!” yelled the
Indians.</p>

<p>“Cannot burn ze kobold!” cried Gilda with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
a squeaky voice that was still funnier with
her accent.</p>

<p>“How did you do it, Gilda? Where did
you get the costume?” cried the girls surrounding
her in admiration. “I never saw
anything so perfect as that nose!”</p>

<p>“Ze Pilgrimette did it!” lisped the Brownie,
hopping on one leg and pointing elfishly at
Nancy. “She found ze long beard growing
on ze trees. She made my nose, so crooked
and pink, wiz ze purple veins, out of a strange—&#8203;what
you call?—&#8203;a leaf.”</p>

<p>“It is a pitcher-plant leaf,” explained
Nancy. “I found one day that it would make
the most perfect nose. And I was just crazy
to wear it myself. But of course I had to
represent the Pilgrims. And Gilda makes
such a nice little round Brownie, doesn’t she?”</p>

<p>“Columbia couldn’t get along without her
fairy-folk too,” said Tante, smiling at the
queer group. “I am glad they came with the
other emigrants. Now let’s have a Virginia
reel in the moonlight.”</p>

<p>So, like the Owl and the Pussy <span class="lock">Cat—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0a">“<i>Hand in hand on the edge of the strand,</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>They danced by the light of the moon</i>,”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">Tante and Uncle Remus leading off. It
was a very pretty sight, with the bright moon
making strange long shadows under the trees.
But if any of the Harbor folk had happened
to stray in this direction, without being warned,
they would certainly have thought the people
of Camp Round Robin had lost their minds!</p>

<p>After the Virginia reel, Tante led the band
in a grand march about the place, and so back
to Round Robin for refreshments. Every
party in Tante’s camp always ended with refreshments.
When they entered the bungalow
they were surprised to find that it was not
empty. By the fire sat a figure, tending it
and brushing up the ashes. He was indistinct
at first. But gradually they made out it was
a man in a tall hat and swallow-tailed coat.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s Uncle Sam!” cried several voices.
“Good for Uncle Sam!”</p>

<p>“It’s Uncle Eph!” announced Nelly Sackett
in the same breath. The tall figure rose
gravely and bowed to Columbia. Captain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
Sackett’s face was indeed like the pictures of
Uncle Sam, with his little chin-whisker, lank
grey hair and long, humorous face.</p>

<p>“Good evenin’, friends,” said he. “I come
to bring the lady her birthday cake. Aunt
Polly made it as a s’prise.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you. Uncle Sam!” Tante took
the beautiful frosted cake, with her initials
“R. B.” marked in the first red raspberries.
“How nice of you to come over!”</p>

<p>“I jest had to see those costumes!” chuckled
Uncle Sam. “You certainly did look fine out
there in the moonlight!”</p>

<p>While they ate salad and cake and Gilda’s
delicious Belgian fudge, and while they drank
Tante’s health in steaming cocoa, Uncle Eph
told them about his costume. “This old hat
has been up in my attic for a hundred years,
I reckon. Belonged to my grandfather. He
was a deacon and a soldier too, and this coat
sorter combined the idea of both, I guess.”
He was watching Nelly and Anne as they
passed in front of him together. “My! don’t
they look alike!” he muttered. “I never
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
would have believed it! Coming home with
me, Nelly?” he asked as he rose to go.</p>

<p>“No, I’m going to stay with Anne,” said
Nelly happily. And he left her there, looking
almost as happy himself.</p>

<h3>NEIGHBORS</h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Once</span> every year Round Robin gave an
entertainment for the children of Old
Harbor. The Camp was rather far
from the village, so they always had the
“show” in the Casino, a little wooden building
which the summer residents had put up close
by the steamer landing. On Sunday the
Casino was used for services by different
groups all day long; early in the morning
Norma, Gilda, and Victor went to hear Mass;
a little later the Batchelders and Cicely had
their Communion; then there was Morning
Prayer which many other summer people besides
Beverly and Dick attended. And Sunday
evening the Casino was filled by a large
congregation in which Anne joined with
Nelly and Captain Sackett. Dick called it a
“Round Robin Church.” Maybe some day all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
the Churches will have one getting-together
service.</p>

<p>During the week the Casino was used for all
sorts of good times. So here it was that Round
Robin was going to give a show for the school
children. The program was practically decided;
Norma would sing, Hugh would
black-up and do a negro song and dance;
Nancy would tell a fairy story. But they
needed one more “act.” Then Nelly had her
great inspiration. “Anne! You dress up in
that sweet Columbine costume and do your
dance. You said you danced Columbine at
a party?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can’t!” protested Anne in horror.
“I don’t know the children here. They don’t
like me. I heard the Maguire children say
so one morning when they brought the eggs.”</p>

<p>“They will like you when they know you;
when they see you in that lovely dress!” cried
Nelly eagerly. And Nancy added her persuasion,
saying it would be just the thing to illustrate
the fairy-story she was getting ready to
tell—&#8203;about a beautiful fairy who danced at
the King’s ball. At first Anne was sure she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
could not do it. But finally she consented.
“I suppose it is time I did do something for
my neighbors,” she said, with poor grace.</p>

<p>And Columbine was the hit of the show!</p>

<p>The hall was full of mothers with their little
children; about fifty of them, all “natives”
of Old Harbor, or at any rate permanent
residents there. The “summer people” had
been invited, too. But they seemed too busy
to come. Anne remembered that she had been
asked to the Round Robin party last year, but
had not had time even to answer the invitation.</p>

<p>Most of the little faces that gazed eagerly
at the doings on the platform were of old
Yankee types. But there were several with
the broad, good natured features of the Irish,
like the four little Maguires. And there were
several handsome dark French Canadians;
several Poles and Finns, whose fathers worked
in the stone quarries.</p>

<p>They loved Norma’s singing, and applauded
her rapturously. They burst into squeals of
mirth over Hugh and his funny dancing,
blacked up as he was and wearing his Unc’
Remus costume. They sat very quiet during
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
Nancy’s fairy-tale, breathless with interest to
see what was going to happen to the plain
little beggar-girl who was invited to the
King’s ball, because she had been kind to a
Pussy Cat, who was really the King’s Fairy
Godmother.</p>

<p>Anne sat on a little stool at the back of the
stage while Nancy told the story. Over her
Columbine dress she wore Tante’s long black
cape that covered her from top to toe, with
the hood drawn over her hair.</p>

<p>“This is Goldie the little beggar girl herself,”
Nancy finished her story, stepping aside
and pointing a wand at Anne. “Now, I am
the Fairy-Godmother—&#8203;Pussy Cat, who met
the beggar girl in the wood. Rise, Goldie,
and show me how you will dance at the King’s
ball to-night. You will dance so beautifully
that he will invite you to be the Queen!”</p>

<p>Nancy waved the wand, and Anne rose
slowly, throwing off the cape as she did so.
There she stood in the beautiful sparkling
dress, a crown of roses on her hair; in
dainty stockings and slippers. <em>One, two,
three!</em> Beverly at the piano, who had played
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
the accompaniment for Norma’s songs, now
began a spirited waltz, and Anne danced her
fairy dance on the tips of her toes, circling
and pirouetting like a real fairy.</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried the children rapturously.
“Oh!” They had never seen anything like it.
No professional “shows” ever came to their
remote little village. “Do it again!” They
begged, so fervently that Anne had to yield.
With cheeks flushed at their pleasure, she repeated
her steps, better even than at first. So
that Norma cried out as she danced off the
stage into the dressing-room, “Brava, Anne!
I didn’t know you had it in you!”</p>

<p>“Aren’t they dear children?” said Anne. “I
didn’t know there were so many of them, and
such pretty little things!”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to come out and let them see
you just as you are,” said Nancy, delighted
with the success of her illustrated fairy-tale.
“They are just crazy, Anne!” So after Norma
had sung another song, and Hugh had declared
the “show” ended, the performers came
out in front and made friends with the children.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
At first the little ones were shy of Anne,
but gathered about her in an admiring group.</p>

<p>“Are you really a Fairy?” lisped one little
tot, touching a fold of the tarlatan dress. “Can
you make my dress look like that?”</p>

<p>“I wish I could!” said Anne, stooping over
the baby, and patting her yellow curls.
“Where do you live, Dear?”</p>

<p>“We live at the lighthouse,” volunteered
the baby’s elder sister. “She’s Patty and I’m
Alice Hopkins. We used to see you riding on
a pony,” she added shyly. “But you looked
cross, then. You didn’t look like a nice Fairy.
Do you wear this all the time now?”</p>

<p>These were the nearest neighbors to Idlewild,
except the Sacketts. But Anne had
never noticed them till now. Their father
had care of the great light that made the Harbor
safe for boats.</p>

<p>The other children pressed close to Anne,
eager to feel her costume and see if she were
real. One little black-haired Finn stepped
up. “Can’t I have one o’ <em>them</em>?” he asked,
pointing to the flowers on Anne’s head.</p>

<p>“Of course you can!” she said, and taking
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
off the wreath she untied it and gave a flower
to each child as far as they would go around.
“They will bring you good luck,” she declared.</p>

<p>Little Tom Maguire, pushing forward,
boasted to the other children. “I know her!
I seen her washin’ dishes when I went to the
Camp ’tother day. She didn’t see me, though!”</p>

<p>“<em>She</em> never washed dishes!” protested Alice
Hopkins. “Never!”</p>

<p>“When the beggar girl went to be Queen,”
Nancy added a postscript to her story for their
benefit, “of course she took right hold of the
housekeeping in the palace. And after that
it was always done right. Because if you keep
house in a fairy way, it is fun. That’s what
the Fairy Godmother brought Goldie to the
palace for—&#8203;to make things jollier all around.”</p>

<p>(“Good for you, Nancy!” Beverly squeezed
her hand on the sly.)</p>

<p>The mothers were talking and whispering
together in the back of the hall, pleased to
see their children so happy. Some of them
had recognized Anne.</p>

<p>“It’s that Poole girl!” one exclaimed in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
amazement. “That proud piece! I didn’t
know she could unbend so far.”</p>

<p>“It’s the childher done it,” observed Mrs.
Maguire with her hands on her hips, nodding
wisely. “If she loves the childher, she’ll be
all right, believe me; rich though she may be,
and spoiled, no doubt. Look at her now wid
me Bridget in her arms! She’ll spoil that
swate dress of hers, entirely! But I daresay
she can get another one aisy-like.”</p>

<p>The children were loth to go away. But
finally the hall was cleared, after Anne had
made promises to come to see them all in turn,
and Nancy had agreed to tell them some day
what happened to the Beggar Girl who became
Queen, and who taught the people how
to put magic into chores.</p>

<p>The teacher of the little village school
lingered for a word with the Round Robin.
“Well!” she congratulated them. “You certainly
did give those children a good time.
I don’t believe you realize all it means to them.
They haven’t much to exercise their imagination
on, of course. It was a great idea to give
them an illustrated fairy-story.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
Nancy said she thought they were unusually
attractive children.</p>

<p>“I wish I could do more for them,” said
Miss Merritt wistfully. “In the winter after
you all go away there’s nobody but me who
can spare time to do much for them. I wish
I knew more! I wish I knew about medicines,
for instance. We are healthy folks here, on
the whole; but things do happen, of course.
You know, we haven’t any doctor here in the
winter. Doctor Black goes away when the
summer people do.”</p>

<p>Anne looked at her in horror. In Mr.
Poole’s house the doctor was always running
in and out at the least “symptom” exhibited
by one of the family. Her step-mother was
continually ailing.</p>

<p>“What do you do when anybody is sick?”
she asked Miss Merritt.</p>

<p>“We do the best we know how,” answered
the teacher. “Most of the women know about
herbs and simple remedies. Some of them
are quite skilled nurses, indeed. But it’s pretty
hard sometimes!”</p>

<p>“I should think so!” cried Anne. “Something
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
ought to be done. I wonder if Father
knows?”</p>

<p>“Children in ’most any place need more
than they get,” said Miss Merritt pathetically.
“If only all the summer people would be interested
in these little neighbors of theirs. For
they are neighbors, even if it is only for a
few weeks.”</p>

<p>The Round Robin agreed that this was another
case where a “getting together” was
needed. And Anne Poole said to herself—&#8203;“I
will ask Father if I can’t help those children
some way.” But she wished she need not
have to ask; Father was so queer nowadays!</p>

<h3>MYSTERY</h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Ever</span> since the adventure of the Round
Robin on the mountain Captain Sackett
had been uneasy. It is not pleasant to
know that there are lawbreakers in your
neighborhood. Hunting deer out of season
was bad enough. But to think of a careless
rifle pointed at any creature in brown—&#8203;who
might have two legs instead of four! The
Captain shuddered, whenever he thought of
Beverly’s narrow escape, and of Nelly’s risk.
Nobody in Old Harbor would shoot deer out
of season; the Captain was sure of that. He
was inclined to think it must be some passing
stranger who had landed from a boat. Or
perhaps it was some shepherd from a neighboring
island where sheep were turned out
for the summer, with one lonely man to keep
them company. The exiles on those far
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
islands who saw no human being for weeks
together were apt to get hungry for mischief
once in a while.</p>

<p>“We’ll keep an eye open,” said the Captain
to Hugh and Victor after one of their troubled
parleys. “Don’t let’s scare the little girls about
it. Only they mustn’t go alone on the mountain
again.”</p>

<p>The young men went warily through the
woods and scoured the mountain and shore for
traces of the deer-chaser, but to no purpose.
Even the deer seemed to have disappeared.
As to the cave, Dick sometimes believed the
ocean had swallowed it up.</p>

<p>Anne kept her secret about the “haunted
hut.” The more she thought about the ominous
stranger’s threatening words, the less she
felt inclined to risk his revenge. How ugly
he had looked! And how wickedly he had
hissed that word “<em>Scalawag!</em>” Sometimes
Anne wished she had told everything to Tante
or the Captain in the first place. But now she
was ashamed to confess how much she had
been afraid.</p>

<p>One day, about a week after Tante’s party,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
Reddy came to Anne with an important air.
“Come out on the rocks!” he whispered.
“I’ve got a secret to tell you. Hurry up with
these dishes.” And seizing a clean dish-towel
he began to rub the plates at a great rate.</p>

<p>“Goodness, Dick!” cried Anne with a
laugh. “You’ll rub holes in the granite ware
if you go at it like that.”</p>

<p>“Well, hurry,” said Dick. “I can’t wait.
But you must promise not to tell.” Anne
promised, and presently they stole away to the
rocks. With much mystery Dick went about
telling her his secret.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve discovered something,” he began.
“And because you were partly in it already,
I thought we ought to have it a secret
together.”</p>

<p>Anne was pleased. “What is it all about?”
she asked eagerly.</p>

<p>“Well; you still insist that your cave was
<em>south</em> of here, do you?”</p>

<p>“Of course it is,” she answered, looking
bored. “Is that all it’s about?”</p>

<p>“No, listen. Suppose that old Geezicks
took you home in a circle? Then your cave
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
might be north of here, mightn’t it? He might
have gone all around Robin Hood’s barn, as
well as Round Robin, mightn’t he?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so!” said Anne. “And it mightn’t
be so far, either. I didn’t see how we went.
He wouldn’t let me look. He wanted to confuse
me. Oh, Dick! You are clever!”</p>

<p>Dick chuckled. “Clever dog, me! Little
old Sherlock Holmes! Well, I think I have
found your cave, not two miles from here the
<em>other</em> way.”</p>

<p>“So near? But why haven’t you found it
before?” Anne stared in wonder.</p>

<p>“I never went that way. There’s no path,
and it is boggy by land. Then by sea it is
full of rips and bars, the worst place along
the coast, I guess. I took the canoe.”</p>

<p>“Did you see my man?” Anne asked eagerly,
but Dick shook his head. “I didn’t explore
much. I thought we’d go together, since the
cave was really your find.” Anne guessed how
much Dick would have liked this adventure
for his very own, and she was touched. “That
was nice of you, Reddy!” she said. “When
shall we go?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
“Right now, if you say so,” he suggested
eagerly. Anne hesitated. “Do you suppose
it is safe for us to go alone?” she asked. “I
haven’t told anybody the whole story.” Then
of course Dick made her tell him everything;
about the hut in the woods and the story that
it was “haunted,” and the threat of the tall
stranger. Only she did not tell him the name
he had called her father.</p>

<p>Dick whistled when the tale was finished,
and his eyes shone. “Great!” he exclaimed.
“It sounds like something exciting. Of course
we will go by ourselves and ferret out the
mystery. Of course I can take care of you!
But we will be careful, yes. What will Hugh
and Victor say, eh?”</p>

<p>Dick was anxious to recover the prestige
he had lost by that laughable fiasco of the
clambake. He wanted to get even with Hugh
and Victor, who had never ceased to tease him
about it.</p>

<p>Anne had some misgivings. But she was
not willing that Dick should go without her.
And she too thought it would be nice to be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
the heroine of a real adventure,—&#8203;if adventure
it was to be.</p>

<p>They pushed off from the landing in the
shadow of the fir-trees. The water of the bay
was as still as quicksilver, just right for paddling,
and Dick was an expert canoeist. He
knew when it was safe to keep off-shore; when
one might dare the neighborhood of those
sharp and cruel rocks that guarded the cliffs.</p>

<p>“Now you must keep calm,” said Dick in
his mock-hero manner. “And whatever you
do, don’t scream.”</p>

<p>“The idea!” said Anne. “Of course I
sha’n’t scream any more than you will. I
didn’t scream before.”</p>

<p>In ten minutes or so they had rounded
several points, and had passed a cove or two
which they had seen before. Then the cliffs
grew higher; the mountain seemed to come
down close to the water. A series of closely-packed
islands near the shore looked as if they
had toppled from the cliff in early days. It
was a wickedly dangerous place for boats.
One felt that it was wise to keep outside these
islands. But Dick had already investigated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
in his light canoe, and knew that it was safe
enough for him.</p>

<p>“I’m going in here,” he said suddenly,
rounding the end of what turned out to be an
island; though at a distance it had seemed
part of the solid shore. Behind this island
was another, the edges “overlapping” as it
were, so as completely to conceal what lay beyond.
Around this too Dick curved. And
lo, there they were in the entrance to a narrow
slit of a cove, running slantwise into the land,
in such a way that no one would ever suspect
its existence, unless he should come upon it
as Dick had done, in a stealthy, threading
canoe. The Indians might have known it long
ago. But there seemed no reason why white
men should ever find it, except by an accident.
At the head of the cove was a beach of sand
strewn with pebbles; quite deserted.</p>

<p>“Well?” said Dick, waiting for Anne to
exclaim. “Well,” she answered, slowly, “is
this my beach? You know I didn’t really see
anything except from the shore. Oh yes,
there’s the cave!”</p>

<p>As the canoe touched the sand, there to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
left yawned the cave. Anne pointed to the
great entrance of rocks, black and romantic-looking.
The pair stole up to it very cautiously,
half expecting something to dart out
at them. But no, it seemed quite empty. Only
a few boxes lay about, with broken sides; some
ropes and pots of paint; empty gasolene cans;
jugs, broken bottles, a sack of straw. “This
might be to make somebody a bed,” said Dick.
“But it hasn’t been slept on yet.”</p>

<p>The cave was some ten feet deep with a
roof high enough for a tall man to stand upright.
There was a hole through the roof in
one place, a natural chimney, and it looked
as if fires had been built there.</p>

<p>“It’s a regular pirate cave!” said Dick. “But
there aren’t any interesting relics at all; not
even a powder-keg or a cutlass.”</p>

<p>“You really thought there were pirates?”
said Anne. “Well, I didn’t.”</p>

<p>“That man was up to some mischief,
though,” argued Dick. “He couldn’t be a
fisherman. There are no lobster-pots around,
or fishing nets, or floats. Though it seems
a likely cove for lobsters, too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
“Here’s the path I came down,” said Anne,
who had been investigating. “It goes up
through these bushes. You wouldn’t notice it
if you didn’t know just where to look.”</p>

<p>“Let’s follow it and see if we can find that
hut in the wood,” said Dick. “I’ll never believe
you weren’t dreaming, unless we do.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Anne with an inward
tremor, “but we must be very careful.”</p>

<p>“Let me go ahead,” urged Dick.</p>

<p>They climbed the steep path which soon
plunged into thick woods, as Anne remembered,
broad and easy to follow. “Looks as
if it was used pretty often,” observed Dick.
Then Anne pulled him by the sleeve. “There’s
the hut!” she whispered, pointing. “You
don’t see it till you are almost on it. I told
you so.”</p>

<p>There was no smoke coming out of the window
now, but Dick motioned her to be
cautious. They crouched low in the bushes
and kept still for several minutes. There was
not a sound about the place. The door was
closed and the litter outside was cleared away.
It looked indeed like the deserted cabin the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
tall stranger had called it. But was it
“haunted”?</p>

<p>“I’m going to peek in at the window,”
whispered Dick. Anne followed him, crawling
on hands and knees. Cautiously they
raised themselves and looked in. The hut
was empty of persons, but full of a disarray
of things. The one dirty window gave
little light, but they gradually made out the
strange, untidy details. In the wall were two
bunks for sleeping. At one side stood a small
stove, the pipe going up through the roof. A
rifle hung on a bracket of deer antlers. The
skin of a deer hung on a chair back. Dirty
plates and knives and tumblers were scattered
over the table. The rest of the room was
filled with a mess of jugs and bottles, kegs and
kettles—&#8203;the strange outfit of some trade which
the girl did not recognize.</p>

<p>“Moonshiners!” whispered Dick excitedly.
Beverly would have known what he meant,
for there has always been this lawless business
in the southern mountains.</p>

<p>“What are Moonshiners, Dick?” asked
Anne, shivering at his tone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
“Why, they make liquor in secret and sell
it in secret. It’s against the law,” said Dick.</p>

<p>“How awful! And he dared call my father
a Scalawag!” thought Anne indignantly. But
it did not matter now. You couldn’t take the
word of a lawbreaker about anything.</p>

<p>“What’s the name printed on that old packing-case?”
asked Dick, whose eyes were growing
used to the dim light of the hut. “Can
you see, Anne?” They both pressed their
noses close to the window panes.</p>

<p>“C. F.” spelled Anne.</p>

<p>“P-O-O-L-E!” went on Dick. “Why
Anne!” he gasped in surprise.</p>

<p>“C. F. Poole!” repeated Anne. “That’s
Father’s name. What can it mean?”</p>

<p>“Maybe they just got the box off your father
somehow,” said Dick uncomfortably. He began
to wish they had not come. “Let’s go
away, Anne.”</p>

<p>But Anne had spied something else. On
the floor under the window was a soiled and
empty envelope. It was addressed to <em>P.
Leveen</em> in a neighboring town. But the writing
was Mr. Poole’s; the date just a week ago;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
and the mark was that of a Canadian city. He
could not write to her, but he could write to
this foreign-sounding moonshiner! Anne did
not mention this discovery to Dick. But it
troubled her greatly. It fitted in disagreeably
with her forebodings.</p>

<p>“We’d better get away,” said Dick. “Moonshiners
are as bad as pirates when you spy
their secrets. We must tell Cap’n Sackett
and have them smoked out, while they’re at
the game.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Anne. “I ought to have told
him before. That may be the very rifle that
nearly killed Beverly!” she thought with a
shudder. “And what will they find out about
Father?” Her only comfort was that Captain
Sackett himself was to be the investigator.</p>

<p>They hurried down the path as fast as they
could, and Anne got into the canoe.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve discovered something all
right,” triumphed Dick as he pushed off the
canoe and crept into his own seat. “It might
be more exciting if we had met those fellows
up there in the hut. But I guess it was just
as well for our health that we <span class="lock">didn’t——”</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
He held his paddle poised and stared
fixedly out to sea. Anne followed his gaze.
A motor boat was making her way in towards
the beach, rapidly. There were two men
aboard. The canoe lay still in the shadow of
the trees while the boat disappeared around
an island. Then, before it should reappear
in the cove, Dick gave some swift strokes of
the paddle that took them out behind another
reef. Evidently they had not been seen. The
steersman was busy threading the narrow, difficult
channel. The other had seemed to be
absorbed in a newspaper. Anne had had a
chance to see both faces clearly.</p>

<p>“The tall man is the one who brought me
home!” she whispered. “And the other one
with the dark face must be the hunter who
nearly shot Beverly!” The pair gazed at one
another. They saw the mysterious boat re-enter
the cove and disappear again. “They’re
both moonshiners,” said Dick.</p>

<p>“One of the two is P. Leveen,” thought
Anne, “and Father writes to him!”</p>

<p>The Round Robin was of course greatly excited
when they told the story of their adventure.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
They could hardly wait to hear what
Captain Sackett would say. But Tante declared
they must not bother him that night.
He was busy about something. Dick was disappointed
also because Hugh and Victor had
disappeared upon some mysterious errand,
and he could not excite their envy with his
tale. Indeed, even Tante seemed preoccupied,
as if she had more important things upon her
mind. But what could be more important
than the arrest of these moonshiners?</p>

<p>“Any mail for me?” asked Dick, and was
told No. Anne did not even bother to ask
about mail for herself. She had quite given
up hoping for a letter from home. And now
she did not want one!</p>

<p>Soon after supper Tante excused herself
and retired to her room with the daily papers
and a packet of mail. Even the Twins could
not help seeing that something was troubling
Tante; but no one could tell Anne what it was.</p>

<p>“Ever since the Veterans brought the papers
she has looked worried,” said Beverly. “We
haven’t seen the news, so we don’t know what
it may be. I hope it isn’t another war! Hugh
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
and Victor went right back to the village,
without waiting for supper. I wonder what
it is?”</p>

<p>Anne sighed. “I always seem to be waiting,”
she said. “I wanted to ask Tante something.
But perhaps to-morrow will do as
well.”</p>

<p>At that same moment Tante was reading
the newspaper, open at a page where a black
head line read—&#8203;“Failure of Great Banking
Firm! Treasurer flees to Canada! Involves
thousands in ruin!” Below was the picture
of a blonde, well-dressed man whom Tante
had seen hundreds of times sailing in his yacht
or riding in his automobile in this very neighborhood,
but to whom she had never spoken
a word.</p>

<p>Presently she came downstairs looking
rather pale. “Let’s have a song before bed,
shall we?” she said. So they sat quietly on
the piazza while Norma sang a slumber song,
to quiet their minds before sleep.</p>

<h3>FIRE!</h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">It</span> was a warm July night. The Camp lay
quiet and serene, everybody sound asleep.
The heat of the day, which had been unusual
for the region, had brought out the
spicy scent of the woods, and mingled it with
the salty fragrance which makes the essence
of Maine. But into the natural blend of outdoors
came creeping another odor, not exactly
unpleasant, but very different; a stinging
disquiet for which the forest creatures have
no name, only an instinctive fear. For it is
no friendly fragrance, but one that spells
danger and death. It was the smell of wood
smoke.</p>

<p>The young men in their tents further south
than Round Robin were the first to get the
tang. They turned over uneasily in their
sleep. Then Hugh sat up on his cot and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
sniffed. He was wide awake in a moment,
like a true soldier, and jumped out of bed.
“Fire!” he thought. And his first fear was
that the hearth-blaze at Round Robin had
caught the bungalow. With dread at heart
he hurried out of the tent and ran up the path
to his mother’s camp. But he soon saw that
the smoke was not coming from that direction.
The slight wind was from the south, and it
brought with it a dense cloud of smoke, drifting
through the trees. The fire was not far
away.</p>

<p>Meantime Victor had wakened and was
pulling on his clothes, wondering what had
become of his tent-mate, and fearing the
worst; when Hugh returned to tell Victor
what he had found out. “The camp’s all
right,” he said. “But there is a big fire somewhere
in the neighborhood; at the Harbor,
I think.”</p>

<p>Dick’s tent was empty. But even while
they were calling him he came running in, all
excitement. “It’s Idlewild!” he cried. “The
whole plant is burning. It’s a great show
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
from the hill. Hurry up, fellows!” And he
was off again.</p>

<p>“We might do something to help,” said
Victor catching up an axe. “Is there a fire
company, or anything?”</p>

<p>“There is a little hand-engine,” said Hugh.
“But I doubt if it can do much if the fire
has got a good headway, since they have
a long way to come. Let’s hurry.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Hugh! What is it?” a girl’s voice interrupted
him. It was Nancy, disheveled, and
dressed in a mackintosh. Behind her came
Cicely with a lantern. “We thought at first
Round Robin was on fire,” she said breathlessly.
“Then we suspected you chaps had set
the woods afire down here. So we came to
see. But it is further off, isn’t it? The sky
is all red. You can see it from the top windows
of the bungalow. Tante and the Twins
are looking at it.”</p>

<p>“It is Idlewild burning,” said Hugh
gravely. “We are going up to help. You two
run home and keep Anne from worrying, if
you can.”</p>

<p>“Run home indeed!” retorted Nancy indignantly.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
“Don’t you suppose we are going
with you? We don’t see a fire every day. And
if it’s <span class="lock">Idlewild——”</span></p>

<p>“Is it Idlewild?” at the word Anne appeared,
breathless, with Beverly behind her.
They were both dressed, and both carried
flash-lights. And they were both very much
excited.</p>

<p>“Goodness!” muttered Hugh. “This is no
time for Round Robins to be hopping around,
in the middle of the night. I’m sorry, Anne.
But you ought to be glad that Idlewild is
empty, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said she, “even the pets are gone.
I want to go and see the last of it, if it is
burning up.”</p>

<p>“Come along the road, then. It’s getting
a little lighter, and there’s still some moon.”
Hugh and Victor took the girls in charge and,
hurried them as fast as they could toward the
direction of the fire.</p>

<p>Poor, splendid Idlewild! It was a pitiful
sight, as all fires are, when so much care and
thought and labor and money go up in smoke.
The whole sky was lit up with a red glare,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
and columns of smoke were pouring out of
the roof of the house. Every little while there
was a crash as a wall fell, and a leap of flame
would follow. The little hand-engine from
the Harbor was already there, and a band of
stout men were ready to help hand the water-buckets.
But the water-works at Idlewild
were out of commission; the fire had caught
in several places and had made too much
headway already. There was scarcely anything
that could be done, but try to prevent
it from spreading to the woods.</p>

<p>A crowd had gathered to see the fire.
People were constantly streaming up from the
village in groups or singly, and they gossiped
excitedly among themselves, commenting on
the fire and on recent news. Victor and Hugh
left the girls together near a group of women,
and ran to help with the buckets.</p>

<p>“There’s Reddy!” cried Nancy, pointing.
Dick was flying around in the smoke helping
Captain Sackett and the other men remove
the contents of some of the smaller buildings.
For it looked as if the whole plant was
doomed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
“The flames are coming out of my windows
now!” said Anne to Beverly. “All my pretty
rooms burned up! I shall never see them
again.” But she did not feel as badly about
it as she would have done two months ago,
had she known what was to happen. “It seems
like the end of everything,” she said. But
Beverly answered:</p>

<p>“Oh no! Maybe it is only a beginning.”
Beverly did not know just what she meant;
but it sounded comforting. And Anne seemed
to like the idea. A woman was speaking in
a high voice just in front of her:</p>

<p>“They say it must have been set. It started
in a dozen places at once. Somebody hated
him pretty bad.”</p>

<p>“I guess there was more’n one!” another
woman spoke bitterly. “He never done no
good to this place. Just feathered his own
nest, he did.”</p>

<p>Were they talking about Anne’s father?
Someone jostled her and she lost Beverly in
the crowd.</p>

<p>“How do you think the fire caught?” a
summer cottager was asking the question of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
a fisherman in tarpaulin and slickers who had
fought the fire till he was exhausted and now
rested on the handle of his axe.</p>

<p>“Fire was sot,” said the man. “Cap’n
Sackett’s got an old Indian woman in charge.
They caught her hangin’ around the place
just after the fire was discovered. Couldn’t
say what she was up to. Cap’n thinks she may
have done it.”</p>

<p>“Sal Seguin!” thought Anne. “I don’t believe
she did it.”</p>

<p>“Poole had enemies enough in this town.
But I don’t know a feller mean enough to do
this trick,” said another man. “Look how
they’re all tryin’ to help now—&#8203;some of the
very ones he let in for a fraud! There’s Doc.
Right, and Lonny Maguire.”</p>

<p>“What does he mean?” thought Anne.
“Fraud? Has someone been doing something
dishonest?”</p>

<p>“He was a mean cur,” said another fisherman,
lounging up to this group, and never noticing
Anne crouching behind them. “I allers
thought so. Anybody who would drive his
neighbors off land that had allers been <em>free</em>—&#8203;that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
ain’t American, I say. Well, we can walk
on it all we want after to-night, I guess. Poole
will be walkin’ elsewhere!”</p>

<p>“Yes, they say he’ll have to go to prison for
what he done,” said the first man. “He took
all my wife’s sister’s savings of twenty years.
And she’s a widder with five children!”</p>

<p>“He done me out of a thousand dollars,”
growled another slouching figure. “I’m glad
his house is gone! I hated to see it here.”</p>

<p>“I guess Poole’s own children won’t starve,”
said a woman’s shrill voice. “He’ll take care
of that!”</p>

<p>“How many’s he got?”</p>

<p>“Only two; a baby an’ that proud, stuck-up
piece who used to ride around last summer,
don’t you know? They say <span class="lock">she——”</span></p>

<p>“Oh, she ain’t so bad!” One of the women
who had seen Anne dance had interrupted.
But Anne moved hastily away before
she heard more. She fancied one of the
men was looking at her as if he recognized
Poole’s daughter. She stumbled along in the
dark which was now lighting into a grey
dawn, thinking vaguely that she would find
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
Cap’n Sackett and ask him why he suspected
Sal Seguin, and what all these strange sayings
meant. She passed behind the garage and
greenhouse, the vegetable garden all dry and
weedy. Between her and Idlewild was the
little hollow containing the old spring-house
and a tomb-like structure of stone, built into
the side of the hollow, that was the ice-house
and cellar. Anne remembered it as windowless
and mysterious, lined with sawdust—&#8203;at
least the part she knew. There was another
part that was kept locked and only Mr. Poole
and the butler held keys.</p>

<p>Anne was amazed to see the door of the
ice-house open, and the ground outside littered
with something. She flashed her light. They
were jugs and bottles like those in the hut on
the mountain. Somebody had been putting
them in—&#8203;or taking them out?</p>

<p>More eager than ever to find Cap’n
Sackett, Anne hurried on around the burning
building to the other side. It was a night full
of mystery and fear. Not until she clasped
the great hand of Cap’n Sackett, who was
standing still for a moment watching the last
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
crumbling ruin of the front wall fall into
ashes, did Anne feel safe.</p>

<p>“Why Anne, child!” cried the Cap’n looking
down at her. “Where did you come from?
Hugh said you was safe with the other girls.
You look tired and hot. You’re tremblin’,
honey!” He put an arm about her. “Come
right home with me. I’ll tell the boys you’ve
gone.”</p>

<p>It was no use arguing. And indeed Anne
had no mind to argue with the Captain. It
seemed so restful and safe to be under his
wing, asking no questions yet, hearing no explanations
of all that puzzled her. She gave
a sigh, and allowed him to lead her by the
hand as he used to do when she was a little
child, down the hill and across the field to the
white house in the Cove.</p>

<p>“Sakes alive!” cried Aunt Polly who like
everybody else in the neighborhood, including
Nelly, was up and dressed. “If this ain’t
Anne!” She stared as if she saw a ghost.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s Anne,” said the Captain quietly.
“She’s all tired out and excited. We got to
put her to bed and let her sleep. It’s a long
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
time till mornin,’ Anne. It’ll be all right in
the mornin’.”</p>

<p>For Anne had tried to ask him one question.
He knew she had heard the gossip. He
saw she was confused with something she
wanted to tell him. But he only smoothed her
hair and said she must go to bed. And
strangely enough, already Anne felt quieted
and comforted, and ready for sleep, in this
house which no longer seemed strange to her,
but in the best sense, “homely.”</p>

<p>Aunt Polly took her upstairs to a little
chamber adjoining Nelly’s. Nelly was still
out with the crowd on the hill, watching the
last of Idlewild. It was a dear little room,
all furnished with pretty things in perfect
order, as if it had not been used for a long
time. “It was Anna’s room,” said Aunt Polly,
softly moving about to get some of Nelly’s
things for Anne’s use, “the Captain’s daughter
who died, you know. It’s the guest room now.
You ought to feel at home in it, Anne. You
have ’most the same name! Now you sleep
sound till we wake you up.”</p>

<h3>NEWS</h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">For</span> years Chester F. Poole had been taking
the money of other persons to line
his own pockets. The savings of the
simple people, his neighbors,—&#8203;lumbermen,
fishermen, farmers and the widows of poor
sailors—&#8203;had gone into his bank, because they
trusted him. And out of this bank he had
built his fine houses and paid for his expensive
living. Now he was found out; and being
a coward he had run away. If the law could
catch him he would have to go to prison. But
the money was gone and spent; nobody could
pay back those too-trusting men and women
and little children whom he had ruined. And
what was to become of them?</p>

<p>This, in a few words, was what had filled
the newspapers with gossip the day before,
but which only Tante, Hugh and Victor had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
happened to see. But after the wild night
at the fire it was no longer a secret to anyone.
Round Robin was an excited camp the next
morning, with so much to talk over. And
because Anne was not there they could talk
freely, about both the fire and the bank failure.
But it was about Anne herself that they were
most concerned. Poor Anne! Could anything
be more dreadful than to be the
daughter of such a man? Poor little Golden
Girl, whose gold had all worn off, because it
was only cheap gilt after all!</p>

<p>“What will become of Anne, Tante?” asked
Norma. “If Mr. Poole has lost every cent
and must go to prison besides, what will his
wife and children do?”</p>

<p>Tante shook her head. “His wife has relatives
of her own, I believe,” she said. “But,
of course, they are not Anne’s relatives.
Mrs. Poole is her stepmother. It is too soon
yet to know what Anne will do. Maybe it
will not be as bad as it seems now.” Nobody
could guess what Tante meant, but her words
seemed to make things a little better.</p>

<p>It had taken some time to make Gilda
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
understand what all the fuss was about. But
when she did realize, she was filled with
horror at this terribly unjust thing which had
happened in her beloved America.</p>

<p>“Why, he is a Hun!” she exclaimed with
her eyes blazing.</p>

<p>“There are selfish people everywhere,
Gilda,” said Tante sadly, “even in America.
Their motto is not ‘get together’ but ‘get
everything for yourself!’”</p>

<p>“But zis is worse zan to be an orphan!”
said Gilda tragically. “My fazzer died, one
brave soldier. My mozzer died of ze frightful
journey, when we were driven out by ze
Huns. I am poor, and I <em>was</em> friendless. But
I was never ashamed.” Her eyes were full
of tears for Anne.</p>

<p>“It is not Anne’s fault,” said Tante. “And
when she comes back we must not seem to
pity her. That would be hardest of all for
her to bear. I think she will be brave, and
that is better than being <em>golden</em>!”</p>

<p>“Anne is a brick!” volunteered Beverly unexpectedly.
“And I know she will be brave.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
I don’t care what her father was. I like
Anne!”</p>

<p>“So do we!” chorused the Club. And then,
without any suggestion at all from their Captain,
they broke into the Club yell, “Heia!
Hoia! Together! Get together!”</p>

<p>Nelly Sackett heard the shout as she approached
the camp, and she did not know
what to make of it. She found them all on
the piazza, just ready for the morning swim.
They all rushed at her. “How is Anne?”
they cried, and Nelly was pleased to see how
eager and affectionate they all were. She herself
looked grave and her cheeks were flushed,
but she did not seem unhappy. Far from it.
“Anne is all right, I guess,” she said. “I have
come to get a few things for her, if Tante will
let her stay another night with us?”</p>

<p>“Of course!” Tante nodded.</p>

<p>“Uncle took her out for a long sail this
morning,” Nelly explained. “He said the sea
would do her good, and calm her down.”</p>

<p>“Has he explained things to her?” asked
Tante, looking earnestly at Nelly.</p>

<p>“I think so,” said Nelly. “I think he has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
told her <em>everything</em>. But of course I haven’t
talked to her, yet. Only Uncle seems to know
just what to say.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Tante, again.</p>

<p>“At first she cried,” said Nelly, “when she
came from the fire. I thought she would make
herself ill. But since the sail she has cheered
up. She—&#8203;she smiled at me!” Nelly was too
shy to tell that Anne had kissed her.</p>

<p>She said that Anne was having a nap now,
to make up for the lost hours of the night
before. Nancy asked if they had found out
who set the fire, and Nelly said that they suspected
the Indian woman. Cap’n Sackett had
caught her wandering about the place while
the fire was going on. And some boys had
found her canoe beached below Idlewild, but
quite empty. Somebody had got into Mr.
Poole’s cellar, where there was a store of
liquor. She was held in arrest on suspicion,
Nelly said; but that was not so uncomfortable
as it sounded.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe Sal Seguin set the fire.
Never in the world!” cried Beverly, championing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
her dusky friend. “Why should she
do it?”</p>

<p>“She hated the white men,” said Norma,
“I remember that.”</p>

<p>“She tried to tell something,” said Nelly,
“but she gets so excited nobody can understand
her gibberish. She keeps saying ‘No,
no, no!’ when anybody asks her questions. But
she glowered and grumbled when she caught
sight of Anne last night. That looks suspicious,
doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Too suspicious,” declared Beverly. “Sal
wouldn’t give herself away like that, if she
had really set the fire. She is not so foolish.
She had a grudge against Anne for something
Anne said when she first came down here.
But Sal wouldn’t burn Idlewild for that! I
don’t believe any woman did it,” said Beverly,
loyally.</p>

<p>“But what was she doing there in the middle
of the night?” asked Nancy. “You know
we saw her once prowling around at midnight,
and several times since then the boys have
spied her near Idlewild.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
“I am going to find out, if I can,” said
Beverly. “I’ll go to see her.”</p>

<p>“Come back with me,” suggested Nelly.</p>

<p>“All right,” said Beverly, “but I won’t
bother Anne.”</p>

<p>Beverly found Sal Seguin squatting on the
floor of Cap’n Sackett’s barn. The Captain
himself sat in the doorway, whittling gravely,
apparently acting as guard of the prisoner,
while the door remained open. “I thought
the poor thing would be more comfortable
here than in the lockup at the Harbor,” he
explained. “Seems hard to shut up an Injun
that’s had the run of the woods; even if she
may be a fire-bug,” he looked at her doubtfully.
“I can’t see what she done it for,” he
said. “She hadn’t any spite against Poole,
like the rest of ’em. She hadn’t any money
to get away. If she had, maybe he’d a tried
to get that too!” He whittled angrily. “She
might have been after the liquor, of course.
But she hadn’t been drinkin’.”</p>

<p>Sal Seguin greeted Beverly with a grunt
that might mean pleasure or the opposite, and
immediately began to gesticulate and to jabber,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
as Nelly had said. “She is trying to tell
me that she didn’t do it,” said Beverly. But
Cap’n Sackett could make as good a guess as
that. “I can’t understand half her words,”
said Beverly, listening patiently to the queer
mixture of syllables, part English and part of
at least one other tongue. “But I do seem
to gather what she means, in a way. Isn’t it
queer? I suppose it’s because I had an Indian
ancestor once.” But it was more likely that
she understood because she was so eager to
help. There is nothing that quickens understanding
so much as sympathy; as anyone
knows who has had a pet animal that other
persons call “dumb.”</p>

<p>“Not set fire! No! No! No!” cried the old
woman.</p>

<p>“Anybody can understand that, whether it’s
true or not,” said Cap’n Sackett. “But what
else, eh? What was she doin’ up at Idlewild?
That’s what I want to know.”</p>

<p>The squaw made strange motions with her
hands, up and down, mumbling as she did so,
words of which Beverly finally made out the
meaning. “Oh, I see!” she cried. “She is trying
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
to say that she was cutting something—&#8203;with
a knife—&#8203;oh yes, in the garden.”</p>

<p>“Ugh!” grunted the squaw, satisfied at last
and nodding her head violently. “Garden,
ugh!”</p>

<p>“But there’s nothin’ in the garden,” said the
Captain incredulously. “It’s all dried up,
except Anne’s flower-bed. She can’t pretend
she came to get vegetables. And I guess she
didn’t want Anne’s flowers, did she?” He
grinned at the joke.</p>

<p>The old squaw listened, with sharp little
eyes first on Beverly’s then on the old man’s
face. “Ugh, no!” she grunted with a frown.
“Not flowers; good-smell-things; make sick
folks well; medicine-plants.” She fumbled
in her pocket and finally drew out a few stalks
of withered herbs, which she held to Beverly’s
nose.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s sage,” said the girl, “or marjoram;
I can’t quite tell which.”
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <a id="i263"></a>
 <br>
 <img src="images/i263.jpg"
 alt="its sage">
 <p class="caption">why its sage</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->
<br>

<p>“Yes, yes!” grunted the Indian eagerly.
“Make medicine, take home to sick Indians.”
An idea came into the Captain’s head. “Wall,
I vum!” he exclaimed. “She was after the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
yarbs out of Anne’s little yarb garden. Ask
if that’s what she’s been comin’ for right
along?” The old woman seemed to understand
him, and began nodding assent. “Come
two-three-four times, up there. Bad man’s
house; nobody home. Medicine plants grow
all alone. No white man want ’em. Me pick
for sick Indian. Not thief, me!” She drew
herself up proudly.</p>

<p>“That’s what I said,” Beverly nodded at
her, smiling. “I was sure you weren’t doing
anything really wrong.” But the Captain
still seemed unsatisfied.</p>

<p>“All very well,” he said, “if that’s all. But
she must have been there just at the time the
fire started. Didn’t she see anybody? Can’t
she tell anything? What about the cellar?”</p>

<p>“Me see! Me tell!” grunted Sal. “Not set
fire. No! No! No!”</p>

<p>“No,” Beverly soothed her. “I understand.
But what did you see, Sal? Tell me. Was
somebody setting a fire?”</p>

<p>“Ugh!” grunted Sal. “Two men.” And
she made the sign of measuring someone tall
and someone short. “Big man, so! Little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
man, so! Bad men burn up bad man’s house.
Bring out jugs,” she made the sign of drinking.
“Run away when see me.”</p>

<p>This was all Beverly could get out of her.
But it was enough to set them thinking. “I
wish I had understood this before!” cried the
Captain jumping to his feet. “We must look
into this! I wonder where the men went to?”</p>

<p>It needed Anne or Dick to give the final
clue. And even while they talked Anne appeared
in the doorway of the barn, a little
pale, but quite herself. It was the frowning
look on the old squaw’s face that caused the
others to turn and see Anne there.</p>

<p>Beverly jumped to her feet and ran forward.
“Oh Anne!” she cried. She had
promised Tante not to bother Anne. But
when she spied her tent-mate standing there,
she couldn’t help giving her a big affectionate
hug. Tears came into Anne’s eyes. So one
of her friends at least did not despise her for
being the daughter of a thief! She put her
arm through Beverly’s and stood facing the
Captain. “I think I know who did it!” she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
cried. “It wasn’t she, it was the two moonshiners.”</p>

<p>“Moonshiners!” The Captain stared.
“What do you mean, Anne? What do you
know about moonshiners?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t had time to tell you yet,” said
Anne. “They have a camp on the mountain,
and a cave on the shore, not far away. Ask
Dick. We saw them. ‘P. Leveen’ is one, and
F—&#8203;Mr. Poole writes to him. They must have
had the key of the cellar; for they had been
taking back their jugs and things.”</p>

<p>“Ugh,” grunted Sal Seguin. “So!”</p>

<p>“I think they burned up Idlewild to punish
me for telling,” Anne went on. “They will
probably do worse now. But I am not afraid
any more,” she smiled at the Captain, “now
you know all about it!”</p>

<p>Here Aunt Polly appeared and led Anne
back to her room. “You got to rest,” she
warned, with a nod to the Captain.</p>

<p>“Ask Dick. He can tell you all about it,”
said Anne over her shoulder as she was led
away.</p>

<p>“Well!” said the Captain. “It’s a queer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
story, if it’s true. Maybe Anne ain’t quite
herself and imagines it all. I must find Dick.
Then, if it’s so, I must get two or three men
and we will go after those moonshiners. <em>P.
Leveen</em>; I don’t know that name.”</p>

<h3>LAW AND LIBERTY</h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> first thing Captain Sackett did was
to look up Dick Reed, who corroborated
Anne’s story, and added some important
details which she had forgotten. “You
come along with me,” said the Captain, “and
we’ll catch those moonshiners redhanded, I
guess.” The Captain also took Hugh and
Victor, saying it would do no harm to have
two young soldiers along, in case of accident.
Besides the boys, he picked up two of his
neighbors, big Bill Chatto the butcher and
Lonny Maguire.</p>

<p>Dick was a proud boy that day, to be guide
of such a party of veterans, about to show
them something which he had discovered by
himself; though he did not fail to give Anne
credit for the original suggestion.</p>

<p>Captain Sackett’s motor boat already trailed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
a dory to be used for landing. But at Dick’s
suggestion they carried also his canoe, he explaining
that with it they could make a swift
and silent entrance to that mysterious cove
where the moonshiners carried on their lawless
business. When the party had almost
reached the cove they anchored the motor
boat, and divided their forces. Dick took
Captain Sackett and Hugh into the canoe, the
others following more leisurely in the dory.
Swiftly and quietly Dick traced the way between
the reefs that concealed the entrance,
enjoying the Captain’s amazement that this
hiding-place had escaped his notice all these
years. He had passed the shore a thousand
times on his fishing trips. But only when you
approached it in the right way, close up under
the rocks, could you spy the cove, open and
deep, penetrating the side of the mountain as
if a giant had split it with his sword.</p>

<p>The beach was deserted. It was high tide,
and the entrance to the cave was lapped by
the waves. Some barrels and broken boxes
were piled up just above the tide line, perhaps
waiting to be shipped. Presently Hugh’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
sharp eyes spied a boat moored in the shadow
of some spruces close to the shore where the
water was deep.</p>

<p>“The men are up in the hut, I guess!”
whispered Dick. “We’ve got ’em!” It was
a thrilling moment for him. The others
seemed excited too, especially Bill Chatto,
who turned purple in the face. Very quietly
they all landed and drew up the boats on the
sand. They made sure that the cave was
empty, then in single file they entered the path
which Dick showed them, creeping like cats
so as not to make the least noise. Captain
Sackett led the way, carrying his rifle ready.
Hugh and Victor followed with their revolvers.
The others armed with axes and
carrying ropes brought up the rear.</p>

<p>Presently they came in sight of the hut. But
before they spied the curl of smoke coming
from the chimney they knew they were not
alone in these woods. The hut was occupied.
The sound of rough men’s voices quarreling
came to them down the path. They lay low
in the bushes, listening, while the shouts rose
higher and higher. Evidently the men were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
quite off their guard, so secure were they in
this lonely spot. The visitors could see the
open door of the hut, and presently out of
this door a man came staggering, with a small
keg in his hands. He had evidently been
drinking. He was coming down the path
straight towards where the officer of the law
and his party were concealed.</p>

<p>“I know him! Wait till he gets close,” the
Captain whispered to the others. “When I
give the signal you two lads and I will trip
this one up and make a rush on the hut; then
you fellers with the ropes can tackle him.”</p>

<p>And that was what happened. “<em>Now!</em>” the
Captain whispered, when the tall stranger
was only a few feet away. The dazed man
was so surprised at the sudden onrush that he
staggered and stumbled straight into the arms
of the waiting fishermen, whose task was thus
made easy. The Captain and the two war-veterans
kept on to the hut and burst in at the
open door. Everything inside was in great confusion.
Bottles, kegs and jugs were overturned
and dripping. Broken glass littered the floor.
A second man was sitting at the table drinking
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
out of a bottle and banging the boards with
his fist, when the party rushed upon him. Before
he had a chance to seize a rifle from the
wall they had his arms bound. And presently
the two men were sitting handcuffed and helpless
but roaring at one another outside their
hut, guarded by the fishermen, while Captain
Sackett, Dick and the two ex-soldiers searched
the cabin.</p>

<p>They found it to be, as they had expected
from Dick’s description, a moonshiners’ den,
full of contraband liquor. Here were all the
tools of that forbidden business. Evidently
for years the pair had been distilling the
dangerous stuff which the law has declared
unlawful to make or sell or distribute. These
men were now not only killing themselves by
slow degrees, but they were breaking the law
and making money by selling danger to others.
Captain Sackett gazed around in surprise and
horror. To think this still should have been
operating under his very nose all this time,
only discovered by accident through Anne’s
being lost on the mountain! She had been in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
danger, too, that made him shudder. For
these were desperate men.</p>

<p>Piled in one corner were some sticks of
dynamite. And with these were some of the
jugs still labeled with the name of <i>C. F. Poole</i>.
Evidently the moonshiners had been doing a
regular business with the rich man, supplying
his cellars with the liquor. And when they
burned his place they could not bear to see
the stuff which he had left behind wasted;
so they had lugged some of it back here
through the woods, to enjoy by themselves,
while the house was crumbling.</p>

<p>The Captain strode out of the house and
faced the two bewildered and cowering fellows.
“What d’ye burn down his house for?”
he asked with a menacing frown. “We know
you done it. Now what for?”</p>

<p>Leveen, the smaller of the two men, began
to jabber in broken English, pointing at his
comrade with accusing finger. “He done it.
He! He! Not me!” Leveen seemed to be a
foreigner of the lowest type, lawless and uneducated.
Though he had come to America,
it was not to be an American. He was what
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
Tante would have called poor material for
the Patchwork Quilt; he never should have
been allowed to baste himself upon it. He
was that impossible kind of “square” that does
not fit into any orderly society, because of its
worn-off corners. He refused to acknowledge
any right or wrong but “liberty” to do as he
pleased.</p>

<p>The other man was different. He called
himself Smith—&#8203;an innocent name enough.
“You Smith!” growled the Captain. “What
<em>you</em> do it for? You know better! You was
born an American; you’ve had an eddication
and a chance. What you burn down a man’s
house for?”</p>

<p>Smith was too intoxicated to be cautious.
“What did Poole cheat me fur?” he growled.
“He done us both; we both paid him off!
Leveen, he’s lying. It was he—&#8203;he lifted the
petrol. Poole wanted to git rich quick. So
did we. He got us to make liquor for him—&#8203;ain’t
it a free country?—&#8203;and fixed it easy so’s
we shouldn’t be found out. He helped our
business and got the advantage of it in two
ways. He took our money and invested it in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
his bank. Invested! He stole it, the mean
scalawag! That’s why we burned his house.
But what I want to know is, how did you find
this place? He eyed the group angrily and
his eyes rested on the three khaki-clad fellows
from Round Robin, with a dawning idea in
his muddled brain.</p>

<p>“Your still was found by accident,” said the
Captain cautiously. “But you were seen
prowlin’ about Idlewild at the fire. You
can’t get around that.”</p>

<p>“Injun woman!” hissed Leveen fiercely.
“She saw. I told you!”</p>

<p>“Shut up!” cried Smith, turning on him.
“You’re givin’ us away!” He did not seem
to know that he himself had already done so.
“I know who told on me,” he went on fiercely.
“It was that gal! You fellers are from that
imitation camp, too. She told on me, though
I warned her. She is Poole’s darter—&#8203;I might
a’knowed she’d queer my game. She’s a chip
of the old block, she is. But she’ll have to
pay yet!” And he uttered wild threats about
Anne.</p>

<p>The Captain grew rigid. “Stop!” he cried
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
sternly. “That little gal is no more Poole’s
darter than I be. She is my grand-darter,
and be careful how you talk now. Every word
you say will be used against you.”</p>

<p>It is hard to say who stared most at these
words; the prisoners, or the three from Round
Robin, or the fishermen. But they effectually
closed the foul mouths of Smith and his
partner. Not another word did they speak
till they were landed in the lock-up of Old
Harbor; a place seldom occupied in this God-fearing,
law-abiding community, where it was
the fashion to respect the comfort of one’s
neighbors as well as of one’s self, in the true
American way.</p>

<p>The boys returned to Round Robin with an
exciting story and a tremendous bit of news.
Indeed, Round Robin found the news more
exciting even than the story of the capture—&#8203;moonshiners
and firebugs and all.</p>

<p>“Did you know who Anne was all the time,
Tante?” asked Dick; and they all looked at
her eagerly.</p>

<p>“Not at first,” said Tante. “Mr. Poole
wrote me early in the summer. I suspected
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
he was in trouble when he said I should have
to tell Anne something unpleasant before
long. Then the Captain told me. It was
better that her own grandfather should tell
Anne about it all; that fine old man!”</p>

<p>“Then Anne never was a Golden Girl, after
all,” said Eddie, who had overheard and half
understood what was being said. “Nor even
gilded,” added Freddie.</p>

<p>“Hush! she may be gold inside,” said
Nancy, thinking of an ending for her fairy
story.</p>

<p>“I wish I had known this before I wrote
Mother,” Beverly mused as she walked away.
“I’ll have to add a codicil.”</p>

<p>“I’ve already telegraphed Father,” Norma
whispered to Gilda in their tent. Girls do
like to tell news!</p>

</div>

<h3>COUSINS</h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> story which the Captain had told
Anne, when they went for that memorable
sail together, was this.</p>

<p>Fifteen years earlier his beloved daughter
Anna had married a man from “the Main,”
as the people of that part of the country called
the mainland. To her parents’ grief he had
taken her to live fifty miles away. How they
had missed her! A year later she came home
for a visit, bringing her little baby, called
Anne—&#8203;“and that was <em>you</em>,” the Captain said,
“the cutest little baby I ever saw!”</p>

<p>Just before it was time for Anna to go back
home, her husband came for her and they
went on an automobile trip with some friends.
The party had a terrible accident, and the
young couple were killed. Their little baby
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
remained for a few months with its grandparents,
who grew to love it dearly. But the
very next spring Captain Sackett’s own wife
died. With all these griefs the Captain was
nearly distracted. He was quite unfit to care
for the little baby alone, and there was no one
to help him. His one hope of recovering a
quiet mind lay in a long ocean voyage. But
what was to become of the little orphan?</p>

<p>Just before this time Mr. Poole came to the
Harbor, and began buying land and cutting
a wide swath. He seemed kind and generous—&#8203;that
was because he wanted to win the confidence
of the people in that place. Many
persons gave him their money to keep. The
Captain did not do that; but he did more.
He give him little Anne. The rich man’s
wife had taken a fancy to the helpless little
one, and as she had no children of her own
wanted to adopt Anne. Mr. Poole was willing,
and it seemed a lucky chance for the baby
to be brought up in comfort and happiness.
No one was ever to know Anne’s history. The
only condition the Captain made was that the
little girl should always be allowed to come
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
to see him when she was at the Harbor, and
that she should call him “Uncle.”</p>

<p>“I thought I was doin’ ye a good turn,
Anne,” the Captain added wistfully. “I
thought he was a good man, and you were lucky.
But I made a big mistake. He was always
selfish. And after his first wife died he grew
more so. You’d a’ been better off with me,
I guess, even if I’d a’ taken ye with me to
sea.”</p>

<p>The Captain told Anne how Mr. Poole had
written him early in the summer that a crash
was coming shortly, and that Anne must be
told the whole truth sooner or later. Poole
could no longer take care of her, for he was
penniless and worse. Anyway, his wife would
have all she could do to care for their own
baby, born this very year of disaster. This
boy of course made all the difference. There
was no longer any place for Anne who, it now
seemed, had never been properly adopted.
He wanted to give her up. He had arranged
for her summer at Mrs. Batchelder’s camp.
After that he shifted the responsibility back
to the Captain. The old man paused here.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
All this had been about the past. Nothing
was said about the future.</p>

<p>At first Anne was only dazed by this toppling
of her whole family and home. But
gradually one thought came uppermost. She
asked only one question, “I am glad I am
not the daughter of a thief!” she said tremulously.
“Oh, I am glad! But if Mr. Poole
isn’t—&#8203;who was my truly father?”</p>

<p>The Captain brightened. “He was all
right,” he answered. “At first I didn’t like
Anna to marry him, because he was a
foreigner. But he was an honest man, a sailor
named Carlsen, a Norwegian.”</p>

<p>“A Norwegian!” Anne stared. The Captain
went on.</p>

<p>“You ought to love the sea, Anne. Your
father came from ’way up in the Northern
ocean, a regular sailor, like me. He was
thrifty and doing well. He had laid by a little.
But of course Poole got that. Lucky he
didn’t get my savings, by gum! I’m not rich,
but I’ve got enough, <span class="lock">Anne—”</span> he broke off
abruptly. He seemed to want to say more,
but perhaps he did not dare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
Anne Carlsen; that was her new name! She
rather liked the sound of it. She had never
cared for the jerky syllables “Anne Poole.”
Her father had been a foreigner it seemed;
and she had despised and laughed at those
other foreigners! And she had not a penny
in the world; no home; nobody who seemed
to want her. But at any rate she was the
daughter of honest people and her grandfather
was the best man who ever lived!
There was nothing for her to be ashamed of
but the foolish ideas she had had in the past.</p>

<p>This was what Anne was thinking this
morning as she moved about the pretty
little room in Cap’n Sackett’s house, next to
Nelly’s, where she had spent two days and
nights as a guest. She was setting the room
to rights and packing her little bag to go back
to Camp. The Captain had said that was what
she was to do at present; there were still two
weeks before the Camp would break up, when
Round Robin would go back to the city and
school. Anne was still in Tante’s care, and
Tante was expecting her, he said.</p>

<p>Anne finished her little chores—&#8203;they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
seemed very easy nowadays—&#8203;and stood looking
out of the window through the branches of
the old apple tree at the bay. It was a sweet
little view. Anne thought she had never seen
a prettier one anywhere; the green grass
above the quiet beach, the sparkling sea beyond
the evergreen trees making a border.
This was the view which her little mother had
loved, too. In that very room she had sung
Anne to sleep, a tiny baby. And that blue vastness
was the ocean which all her Yankee ancestors
had loved; so too had her Norse father,
of a race of famous sailor-men. Anne remembered
it was the Norse sailors who had really
first discovered America.</p>

<p>Little white waves were breaking up on the
beach where Cap’n Sackett was just landing
from his boat with a basket of fish. He
had been out since four o’clock that morning.
How hard he worked; and how everybody
respected him! It was fine to be honored by
your neighbors.</p>

<p>Someone tapped on the door and Nelly entered.
“Hello,” she said. “Can I help? Oh,
you’re all ready. Anne! I’m sorry you are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
going away! I wish you were going to stay—&#8203;always!”
Nelly stammered at the last word.</p>

<p>“It’s funny, but it seems like home,” said
Anne simply. She felt suddenly lonely at the
thought of going away from this nest into
which she had fluttered almost by accident;
before she knew it had been builded by her
own flock of sea-birds, and that she herself
had once been sung asleep in its safety. “How
long have you <em>known</em>, Nelly?”</p>

<p>Anne had no need to explain what she
meant. Nelly knew she was thinking of her
name and history.</p>

<p>“I think I have always guessed it,” said
Nelly, “ever since I first saw you on the pier,
the day you landed. I felt as if we were <em>something
together</em>. I can’t explain what I mean.
No, you didn’t feel so, I know; it didn’t seem
possible, then. No person told me till Uncle
Eph did the other day. I just <em>intued</em> it!” She
looked shyly at Anne.</p>

<p>“You must have hated me,” said Anne, remembering
the disagreeable airs she had put
on and the way she had snubbed Nelly
Sackett.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
Nelly considered her cousin gravely. “No,”
she said, “I didn’t hate you. I thought
maybe that was the way I’d feel if I were
in your place. Money often does turn people’s
heads, doesn’t it? We aren’t a bit alike,
really. But I guess there is something alike
inside us. There must be inside everybody.”</p>

<p>Anne had been thinking of something else
that troubled her. “What do you suppose
will become of me?” she faltered. “I never
thought about planning things till now. Nobody
wants me, Nelly. Mr. Poole just gives
me up—&#8203;though I can’t be sorry for <em>that</em>! If
anybody wants to adopt me, all right, he says.
But why should anybody want to? I’m no
good. I’m just expensive.”</p>

<p>Nelly began to laugh, recalling how well
Anne had fitted into their simple domestic life
during the past two days; how many kinds of
things she had learned to do in this queer
summer; and how everybody was growing to
like her. “Golden Girls sound expensive,”
she said, “but maybe they are not so bad, when
you know them.” Anne did not laugh at
the old joke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
“Suppose nobody wants me?” she said.
“What happens to people like that? Do they
go to the poorhouse? If I could be earning
my own living it would be different. But how
can I, now? I don’t know enough.”</p>

<p>Nelly shook her head. “Not yet,” she said.
“We are not old enough.” She had been
thinking about these things too. “But don’t
forget that Uncle Eph is your grandfather.
You’ve got somebody behind you, anyway.
That’s more than a good many children have.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t say he could help,” murmured
Anne. “He didn’t offer.”</p>

<p>“He was afraid of you,” said Nelly eagerly.
“I know how it is. He thought he would
seem too <em>plain</em> for you. He thought it was
too sudden to come down from the idea of
Idlewild to this house! But he wants you,
I know, if you’d be happy. He said so. He
thinks maybe you can do better. But he
would take care of you, just as he takes care
of me. We’d divide everything. We’d be
like sisters, Anne. I’d let you share my
mother!”</p>

<p>Anne turned from the window and looked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
at Nelly with new eyes. What a wonderful
thing it would be to have a sister! Since living
at camp she had begun to realize how
nice it was to be close to other girls and do
things together with them. She and Nelly
really were cousins, that was certain. And
how different Nelly seemed to her now that
she knew her better. How unselfish she was!</p>

<p>“We’ll be like sisters anyway,” she said impulsively,
“but the Captain—&#8203;Grandfather—&#8203;couldn’t
support another big girl like me?”</p>

<p>“He isn’t poor,” said Nelly. “We can both
learn to do something. Then some day we can
both pay him back. What will you be,
Anne?”</p>

<p>Anne had never really thought of <em>being</em>
anything until this moment. “Be? Why—&#8203;I’d
like to be a teacher,” she said suddenly.
The idea popped into her head like an inspiration.
“I’d like to teach foreigners how
to become good ‘squares’ in the Patchwork
Quilt, as Tante calls it. Oh yes! And I’d
like to learn how to take care of little children
like the children around here. I’d like to be
able to nurse them or doctor them when they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
can’t get a doctor in a hurry. I wish I could
make up to this place for the things I had
when I was little, when I didn’t know who
was paying for them. I didn’t know it, but
I was a <em>Pig</em>!”</p>

<p>Nelly listened eagerly. “I think it’s a lovely
idea,” she said, hugging Anne around the
neck. “You can’t be everything; but you are
awfully clever—&#8203;much smarter than I. I want
to be a teacher, too. But you can do a lot
beside. Some day you will be my boss, I
know; and you will like it, too.” Nelly understood
her cousin pretty well already.</p>

<p>“Hello, Anne!” called the Captain from
the foot of the stairs. “Ain’t ye most ready
to go? They’re expectin’ ye, I guess.”
Anne turned red. He seemed anxious to be
rid of her, she thought. But when she saw
his kind face she knew better. “I’m going to
tell Uncle Eph what you said you wanted to
be,” Nelly whispered, and she burst out with
the whole story before Anne could stop her.
The Captain listened gravely, with his eyes
resting affectionately on Anne, but all he said
was—&#8203;“That’s good!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
“Thank you for being so kind to me, and
for telling me all about myself so nicely,” said
Anne a little stiffly. “I have had a very nice
time here, and—&#8203;I’m glad you are my Grandfather!”
The Captain beamed.</p>

<p>“I’m glad ye’re not ashamed,” he said.
“Now ye’ll run over to see us often, won’t
ye? It ain’t long before Mrs. Batchelder
breaks up camp, ye know, and <span class="lock">then—”</span> he
waited, “we dunno <em>what</em>.”</p>

<p>“Of course I’ll come,” said Anne. “This
seems like home, now.”</p>

<p>“Does it?” the Captain’s face brightened.
“Wal, I wish it was, truly. Of course it can
be, Anne, if ye want it. It’s plain. But the
door’s open. No, don’t say anything now.
Maybe ye’ll have a better chance. But anyhow,
here is my little Anna’s place ready for
ye. I’ll send ye to school. I can help ye
do whatever ye want to, I guess. Life won’t
be so easy for ye, as it used to be. But it
needn’t be empty. I don’t want to press ye,
I give ye up once, and I guess that cost me
the right to ye now. I thought I was doin’
the best thing for ye then. But I made a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
mistake. Now maybe ye’ll know what’s best
for yourself, if you have a chance. Anyway—&#8203;no
hurry!”</p>

<p>“Oh Grandfather!” Anne ran up and
hugged the old man around the neck, till the
tears came into his eyes. “How good you are!
I’d choose this home <em>anyway</em>!”</p>

<p>But the Captain gently shook his head.
“There, there!” he said, “Don’t ye go too
fast, little gal. I don’t want to take advantage
of ye. Wait till ye get your bearin’s. It’s
all so sudden for ye. I wanted ye to see this
house and the way we live, so’s you’d know
what ye was doin’ ef ye chose us. But take
time. Finish out yer summer at the Camp,
and see what happens. Then we can talk it
over again. Run along now. They’ll be expectin’
ye.”</p>

<p>Aunt Polly added no word to the Captain’s
invitation, but kissed Anne affectionately and
said good-bye.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am so glad somebody wants me!”
thought Anne, as she and Nelly walked slowly
along the road together, talking of many
things.</p>

<h3>A CHIP OF THE OLD BLOCK</h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> summer was drawing to a close.
There were only two weeks more of
Camp, and Round Robin was resolved
to make the most of this fortnight, before the
little group should scatter to the four quarters
of the land. For as Dick said it was like
“boxing the compass” when they compared
their winter plans. Dick was putting in long
hours finishing up his studies with Hugh, before
starting back to his home in the far West.
Beverly, like the summer birds which were
already showing restless flutterings in the treetops,
would soon be flitting South. Victor was
going to try his fortunes in New York, where
Norma lived. Gilda and the Batchelders
were due in Boston, where the public schools
open early. And Cicely must sail back to
England before the autumn storms were due.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
Nelly Sackett was still in High School at Old
Harbor; she alone would remain, it seemed.
Then there was Anne. What about Anne?</p>

<p>Round Robin was agreed that they must all
treat Anne exactly as if nothing had happened.
Anne was still Anne, and they had voted her
a full and satisfactory member. The thing
was to have as good a time and to make her
have as good a time as possible in the short
weeks left of the precious summer. There
weren’t likely to be any more such exciting
happenings as had kept them all on tenterhooks
during these last days. But there were
picnics and excursions planned; the hours
were not long enough for all the delightful
things they had put off till the end of summer,
while the days were already growing shorter.</p>

<p>The morning Anne was expected back to
camp Tante sent the Twins off to pick blueberries.
Cicely and Nancy had already started
with baskets for a “mushroam,” as they called
a tramp to find the delicious tawny chanterelles
that hid in the shadows under the spruce
trees. Dick was studying in his tent; some
of the others had gone for the mail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
Beverly announced that she was going to
see Sal Seguin. The old Indian woman was
free again, but Captain Sackett had let her
live in his barn for a day or two, while she
was being questioned about what she had
seen that night when Idlewild was burned.
Beverly wanted to give her a little present
before she went home, for she and the old
woman had become very good friends. Tante
was left alone at Round Robin to welcome
Anne; which was exactly what she had
planned. She did not know that at this very
moment Norma was racing breathless along
the road, hoping to intercept Anne at the end
of Cap’n Sackett’s lane.</p>

<p>“Heia! Hoia!” sang Norma in her musical
soprano as she spied the two girls coming towards
her, and in her dramatic Italian way
she flourished a paper high in the air. Anne
and Nelly, who were talking earnestly together,
stopped their conversation and came up to her
with a question. It did not seem as if there
could be any event left to cause such excitement.</p>

<p>“Good news!” called Norma, her big eyes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
shining. And running forward she seized
Anne in her arms and kissed her warmly.
“I have had an answer to my telegram. I
thought it would come this morning.” The
girls still stared. They did not know about
any telegram. But Norma explained that it
was from her father in New York. “Let me
read it,” she said unfolding the paper. “I
ran all the way from the Post Office because
I couldn’t wait, Anne.”</p>

<p>The telegram was, after its kind, brief and
emphatic. “‘Wire needs of your girl friend.
How much? Tell her bank on me. G. Sonnino.’—&#8203;There!”
said Norma triumphantly.
“That’s just like Father! Now it’s all right.”</p>

<p>But Anne looked puzzled. “What do you
mean?” she said. “I don’t understand.”</p>

<p>“It means that as soon as Father heard
about—&#8203;about your trouble, Anne, he just
wanted to help. You can count on him for
money enough to do whatever you please—&#8203;for
a while, anyway. Father will do anything
for me, Anne. I am so glad!”</p>

<p>“Oh Norma!” exclaimed Nelly, glancing
sidewise at Anne. She was afraid the impulsive
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
girl would hurt her cousin’s feelings.
Anne flushed a little and hesitated.</p>

<p>“It is awfully good of you Norma, and your
Father is kind as can be,” she said. “But—&#8203;but
I hope I shall not have to borrow any
money from—&#8203;from outside my family. I
have a family, you know, Norma! Nelly is
my cousin and Cap’n Sackett is my grandfather.
I don’t think he would want me to
take money from anyone else. Would he
Nelly?”</p>

<p>Nelly shook her head. “I don’t think so,”
she said emphatically. Norma’s face fell.</p>

<p>“I am so disappointed,” she said. But she
was wise enough not to press the point. “Well,
I suppose I may as well wire Father now,”
she said, turning reluctantly back towards the
village. “He will be sorry. He loves to
help.”</p>

<p>Here and there along the road a maple leaf
turning red showed that the short summer was
nearing its end. Blackberries were ripening
above the stone walls. The birds were flitting
in little groups through the treetops,
keeping together, ready for their coming long
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
flight. The golden rod stood suddenly ablaze,
and the asters were putting on their royal
purple.</p>

<p>“What a lovely road it is!” said Anne. “I
never used to notice such things, but I have
got new eyes this summer.”</p>

<p>They were about half way to Round Robin
before they met Beverly. “Oh Anne!” she
cried running up as soon as she saw the two
cousins. “I <em>am</em> so glad to see you again. I
have missed you awfully. I’m on my way
to see old Sal. But I’ll be back before
luncheon. Let’s go for a swim as soon as I
get back, shall we?”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Anne, glad to be offhanded.</p>

<p>Beverly turned on her heel as she was just
disappearing down the path, “I say, Anne,”
she drawled, “don’t you make any engagements
for October! I’ve written Mother already
that you are to come and visit us in
Virginia for at least a month. We’ll have
the best time! Everybody will want you; but
don’t forget I’ve asked you first.” Anne
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
beamed upon her with pleasure. Beverly was
such a dear!</p>

<p>“I’d love to come, if I can,” she said. “But
I’ll have to ask Grandfather, of course. And
I don’t know about school yet.”</p>

<p>“We’ll fix it somehow,” Beverly nodded.
“Mother will be crazy to see you. And you’ll
love Liveoaks, our old place. Well, so-long!
I’ll have to hurry if we are to get that swim.”
And Beverly moved on, as fast as Beverly
could.</p>

<p>“How dear they are!” thought Anne. “I
never would have believed it, six weeks ago!”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, with Patsy in her lap, Tante
sat on the piazza of the bungalow watching
for Anne. As she darned the stockings of the
Twins she glanced up every now and then
anxiously. Anne was late. All these meetings
and talks had delayed her and Nelly.
When at last Tante saw the two girls coming
along the path she laid down her mending
and went to greet them with a sweet smile.
“I am glad to see you back, Anne my dear!”
she said, cordially. And Patsy arching his
back seemed to agree with her, in an amiable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
purr. “These two days have seemed long
to us.”</p>

<p>Nelly lingered at the foot of the steps. She
hated to give up this new-found cousin of
hers. “I guess I will go back now,” she said,
reluctantly. “Will you come over to-morrow,
Anne?”</p>

<p>“Of course I will,” said Anne heartily.
“Don’t feed the rabbit till I come. I want
him to be glad to see me.”</p>

<p>“You don’t need to worry. We shall all
be glad enough,” grinned Nelly. Anne waved
her out of sight. Then she sat down on the
piazza steps at Tante’s feet. It seemed as if she
had been gone a week. But Tante acted exactly
as if nothing had happened. Tante always
treated everybody the same at one time
as at another; which was one reason why
everybody loved her so much. She told Anne
some of the things the Club had planned for
the next two weeks. Then she said quite
casually that of course the Camp would be
closed in September, and not opened till another
summer.</p>

<p>“Another summer!” said Anne. “I suppose
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
I shan’t see any of you till then. Won’t it
be odd?” Tante asked her if she had any plan
for the winter, and Anne hesitated. “Not any
regular plan,” she asked. “You know everything
about me, don’t you, Tante?” Tante
said yes, she did.</p>

<p>“I have a foreign name now!” said Anne.
“Isn’t it queer? I can’t quite get used to being
<em>Anne Carlsen</em>,” she spoke it strangely. Tante
asked her if she liked her new name, and
Anne confessed that it sounded better to her
than the old one. Then Tante said a strange
thing:</p>

<p>“Because, if you don’t like it we can change
it. How would you like the name of Batchelder,
for instance? How would you like to
call Nancy your sister, and Hugh and the
Twins your brothers, Anne?”</p>

<p>“Tante!” Anne gasped. What was she being
offered? Nothing less than a new home
and family. She had seen enough of that
family to guess what a beautiful home they
must have. Seeing Anne speechless, Tante
went on to tell her how she had consulted her
children and how they were pleased with the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
idea. They were not rich, she said. They
lived in a simple city house, not in the least
like the former luxurious home of Mr. Poole.
They had no servants, and they all shared the
work together, just as at Round Robin. Tante
was a teacher, and so was Hugh. They would
all have to earn their living some day. But,
Tante said, all American children ought to
be able to do that, whatever the future held
in store for them. Anne should go to school
with Nancy and learn the things she wished.
Then in summer there would again be Camp,
which was Tante’s “business.”</p>

<p>“You will be treated just the same as one
of my own children, Anne,” said Tante. And
Anne knew that Tante never said what she
did not mean.</p>

<p>“Oh Tante! And you have such a big
family already!”</p>

<p>“We have a big house,” smiled Tante. “We
love to keep it filled.” Anne seemed to feel
the warmth of happiness that must brim the
rooms in Tante’s big house, radiating from
Tante’s own big heart. Then suddenly she
had a vision of the Captain’s happy look when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
she had first called him “Grandfather,” and
of Nelly’s wistful good-bye. And she had a
curious counter-pulling of her heart towards
those people who really belonged to her.</p>

<p>“Does Grandfather know?” she said falteringly.
Tante nodded.</p>

<p>“Certainly, I consulted him first,” she said.
“He is willing you should choose for yourself,
between his home and mine. Of course,
you would still see him in the summer; but
I should want to adopt you legally and have
you take our name.”</p>

<p>Anne Carlsen stood looking at the ground,
thinking harder than she had ever thought in
her life before. What Tante had said made
her very happy. To think that these lovely
people wanted her in their family! And
wanted to share with her their good old
Yankee name! She was not yet quite familiar
with her own proper Norwegian name; why
should she mind giving it up so soon? And
yet—&#8203;strangely enough—&#8203;Anne did not want to
give it up!</p>

<p>“My <em>real</em> name is Carlsen,” she was
saying to herself. “I never thought about
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
what a real name meant, before. This one
sounds foreign, but it is <em>mine</em>; given me by
my good sailor father whom I never knew. I
lost it once without knowing; now I have got
it back again. And I’d like to keep it and
make it real American. It is only a <em>sound</em>;
that is all the Batchelder name is, too. But
it’s <em>mine</em>. And I can only be myself, not a
Batchelder.” She looked up at Tante with a
wrinkle in her forehead, because she had been
thinking so hard.</p>

<p>“You don’t have to tell me right away,
Anne,” said Tante kindly. “Think it over,
Dear.” But Anne shook her head.</p>

<p>“Oh, Tante, you dear Tante!” she replied
in a low voice. “I love you all for inviting
me. But if Grandfather wants me—&#8203;and I
think he does, Nelly says so—&#8203;I want to be
his girl. I want to make good with my own
name, too. I think Grandfather would like
that; because of my mother.”</p>

<p>Tante kissed her affectionately. “You are
a dear little girl!” she said. “And you have
thought things out pretty clearly, I see, in this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
short time. But you mustn’t be in a hurry.
Take time before you decide, Anne.”</p>

<p>“That is what Grandfather said. But I
have decided already,” said Anne firmly. “I
know I am doing right. If Grandfather
wants me, I am going to stay with him and
Nelly. I shall do as he says, about school and
everything.” And she told Tante what she
hoped to be, when she should grow old enough
to help in the world.</p>

<p>“I think you have chosen right,” said Tante.
“But the children will be disappointed. Your
Grandfather and I shall have to do some planning
together.”</p>

<p>“Oh Tante! It is so nice to be <em>wanted</em>!”
said Anne fervently.</p>

<p>Then the Twins came racing up. “Hooray,
Anne!” cried Freddie. “Come and play Indian
with us, will you?”</p>

<p>“Come and see how we’ve finished the house
you began for us, Anne,” said Eddie pulling
her by the hand. “It is so nice to have you
back!”</p>

<p>“I’m coming,” said Anne. “And here’s
Doughboy, too! But you just ought to see
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
my rabbits, Twins. Will you go over with
me to Grandfather’s house to-morrow and see
Plon and the others? That will be fun!”</p>

<p>Tante watched them racing down the path
towards the sea; then went out to meet Nancy
who was just returning from a visit to the
Maguire children.</p>

<p>“Anne has decided to remain Anne Carlsen,”
she said briefly. “I thought she would.”</p>

<p>“Well, I didn’t,” confessed Nancy. “I
thought she’d jump at our family, Mother!
The Golden Girl was just lonesome all the
time, when we thought her disagreeable. I
didn’t half understand her.”</p>

<p>“If you are going to write stories—&#8203;or do
anything else successfully, for that matter—&#8203;you
will have to learn to understand people,”
said Tante smiling. “It is a great part of
Imagination. Fairy Stories are only another
small part, Nancy.”</p>

<h3>A BEGINNING</h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">One</span> beautiful blue day early in September,
several persons stood on the
pier at Old Harbor watching the little
steamer move away. It was bearing the larger
part of the summer colony back to their
winter homes, leaving but a few to wave them
a good-bye. But this was not a sad occasion,
not the regretful ending of anything. Instead
it was but the happy beginning of something
still better; which is what all so-called “endings”
ought to be.</p>

<p>Nelly Sackett and Anne Carlsen stood on
the pier close together, waving their handkerchiefs
to the group gathered on the upper
deck of the boat, where Anne had stood alone
that June day weeks ago, so helpless and unhappy.
Down below, Cap’n Sackett in his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>
dory was waiting to row the two girls back
to the Cove and Aunt Polly.</p>

<p>For this is what Tante and the Captain had
agreed between them, after a long consultation
and much thinking. Nelly and Anne
were both to spend the winter in the city,
where they could go to school with Nancy
and plan the next step in the work each most
wanted to do. They were to live in the big
Batchelder home, almost as if they were a
part of that hospitable family.</p>

<p>And already Round Robin had planned a
grand reunion for the holidays. Instead of
Anne’s going to visit Beverly in the south,
Beverly herself had promised to come to Boston.
Norma would find it very easy to come
on from New York; and Victor too, for a
few days at least. Gilda was already a neighbor
of the Batchelders in a happy suburban
home. Cicely would have to be represented
by a letter from across the sea; and Dick by
another from his school across the great western
plains. But East, West, North, and South
would be together in spirit at least on Christmas
Day, looking forward to another summer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
Meanwhile, the Captain could not spare his
two girls just yet, he said; even if it meant
beginning school a few weeks late. This delay
would give them all time to make certain
readjustments and arrangements. And it
would give Anne a chance to see her country
home in its most beautiful days, when the
leaves had turned and the grass would be
rusty-brown, and the wild cranberries ripe in
the high bogs along the dunes. For it is not
until the summer “transients” have gone away
that the wild country puts on its choicest
beauty, and its gaudiest colors; when the
ocean plays its grandest games for the benefit
of its own people, the sea-lovers who linger
beside the great deep and are loth to go away.</p>

<p>“I am glad I am not on that boat now!”
Anne confided to Nelly’s ear. “Just think
how hot and stuffy it will seem in the city
when they wake up to-morrow morning! But
we shall still be breathing this sweet, spicy air,
and looking at this blue water!”</p>

<p>“It’s pretty here in the winter, too,” said
Nelly. “Sometime we must invite the Round
Robin here for the holidays; some day when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
you and I have made our fortunes, and have
turned our old house into a wonderful steam-heated,
electric-lighted, summer-and-winter
home. Won’t that be fun?”</p>

<p>“We’ll do it!” cried Anne, with a firm nod
of her head—&#8203;like her grandfather’s—&#8203;that
meant business.</p>

<p>“Heia! Hoia!” shouted the girls on the
steamer, as the engine bell rang. “Good-bye,
Nelly! Good-bye, Anne! See you soon! Together!
Round Robin!”</p>

<p>“Heia! Hoia!” answered the cousins on
the pier. “We’ll bring you all a branch of
trailing yew and a cedar tree from Round
Robin when we come down.”</p>

<p>“And a bunch of fresh catnip for Patsy,
and some ripe cranberries! Together! Round
Robin!”</p>

<p>The people lingering on the pier grinned
good-naturedly at the two girls as they climbed
down into the Captain’s boat, when the
steamer was out of sight. Whatever belonged
to the Captain they accepted without question.</p>

<p>“Ye’re havin’ two little lassies now instead
of the one, ain’t ye, Cap’n?” chuckled Lonny
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>
Maguire, leaning over the railing for the customary
parting shots between him and his
neighbor.</p>

<p>“Wal, I dunno!” said the Captain with a
twinkle. “Accordin’ to ’rithmetic, two gals
for half a year ought to be about the same as
one gal for a whole year. Ain’t that so?”
Lonny retired with a guffaw, to spread this
joke abroad.</p>

<p>“Two girls for always, Grandfather!” Anne
corrected him. “Wherever we are, even if it
is far from here, it’s home by the sea where
you are.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Nelly, taking an oar and handing
another to Anne, “wherever we are, we
shall be in one boat, pulling <em>Together</em>!”</p>
